[{"content":"📰 What\u0026rsquo;s New? #  🗣 All time high in terms of communication metrics. 👋🏼 Goodbye Ben. 🪜 Continuous progress on all aspects. 🦷 Re-scheduled dental plans.   🏫 Therapies and Schools # Therapies # 🎙 Speech Therapy #  We’ve recorded an all time high in terms of Andriel’s use of main communication words: More, Help, and Yes. They are at a functional state at this point, that the words that he speaks mean the actual message. We will continue working on this to make sure that we get that level of consistency. We will also implement “1 up” with these words to encourage Andriel to go beyond the word. Example: “More banana”, “More drink”, “More egg” Andriel’s listening and receptive skills have dramatically improved as well, specially on an outdoor setting. Things like “Press Up” on elevator gets 100% accuracy and he won’t have to button smash things. He also recognises people’s distinct voices, as evident of him looking at his dad whenever he’s being called whilst outdoor. Andriel continues to expand his vocabulary as well as continues to attempt to say the words based from his intent. In a fruit basket, it’s very distinct that he would request for: “Apples”, “Oranges”, and “Banana”.  🧠 Psychologist / Behaviour Therapy #  We had our last session with Ben from Cross Care. Throughout the months, Andriel have learned the basic emotions and can determine on pictures people who are “Sad”, “Happy”, and “Angry.” Andriel (and the parents) is equipped with tools to handle anger management such as doing the “Elephant sound” to perform simple breathing exercises. As part of this, Andriel also tends to have less frustration as he was able to communicate better what he wants and needs. We also decided to opt out from a Psychology therapy for the time being.  🚴‍♀️ Occupational Therapy #  Andriel has adjusted with the new schedule and OT. Andriel shows a lot of interests in activities that involve movement. Priya builds up on top of this by adding extra steps or complexity on it. Such as instead of just swinging, we also teach Andriel to kick. Andriel shows to learn those skills quite fast when he’s very engaged. Andriel does a lot of “sit in” activities such as scissors cutting, drawing, and play dough activities. This is to prepare Andriel in a school environment.     Pre-schools # 🌈 SDN Beranga (Autism Specific) #  The educators continue with the implementing the Individual Education Plan (IEP). As part of the plan and alignment with the speech therapist, the educators will encourage Andriel with verbal communication and the visual communication devices (cards and iPad) becomes secondary. Andriel participates in variety of activities and 1-on-1s with Yashu (key educator). Andriel loves playing outside, and his particular favourite is the monkey bars.  🦋 Papilio Ingleburn (Mainstream) #  Andriel participates on indoor plays. He particularly likes the wooden blocks. This develops his creativity on what he can build from his imagination. He also enjoys playing outside.     🪜 Primary Schools #  We’ve met up with one of the catholic schools in Sydney Southwest and they will have to circle back to us regarding what support they can do for Andriel. They might also include Sydney Catholic Schools (Main Office) in the discussion. We’re still waiting for his Paediatrician’s up to date diagnosis report to be sent to Aspect Macarthur as part of enrolment prerequisites. We’re still waiting for Austral Public school if any further actions are required.   🏡Home and Family Activities # Home Updates # Toileting. Andriel is very consistent with toilets whether at home, schools, or outdoor settings. He doesn’t wear nappies anymore, even at sleep! He goes to the toilet every morning and frequently from then. On occasions that he feels like going to the toilet, he will do it by himself at home. However, he is still working his way on the “Vacuum sound” of hand dryers of public toilets as this is something that makes him uncomfortable.\nDentist. Andriel is re-scheduled next month for his dental surgery. He had a mild flu and cough on the day of his scheduled operation and we were advised to re-schedule next month instead.\nHome Therapies. At home, we are using various materials as a form of activity for Andriel to learn new skills and knowledge. We use a variety of iPad learning applications, interactive songs, activity book (provided by Papilio Ingleburn), and physical toys. We observed that Andriel continues to participate on activities given the right rhythm of breaks, “accompany toy”, activities he liked vs activities he dislikes.\nOutdoor observations. Andriel will still hold his dad or mum’s hands whenever he goes out. He has a very good stamina in terms of how far he can walk whenever he’s outside. Whenever he goes for a run, he would actually look at you and acknowledge your presence (asking you to chase him). He is aware of spatial surroundings and doesn’t have problems navigating crowded places, slopes, and narrow pathways.\nFamily Gathering. Andriel is OK with having a large group of people around him. For the first time, he was also able to “play” with his cousin “Milly” in a playground. Andriel shows eye contact to acknowledge that he’s playing “with someone” and also follows Milly’s lead.\n📸 Photos and Activities #              ⏭️ What\u0026rsquo;s coming and Notes from Parents? #  We’re looking at ways to prepare Andriel towards being “a brother” and how the new baby will impact his life.      We are also encouraging Andriel to start wearing socks as the cold weather comes.

He is now getting trained on new words such as colours (yellow, red, blue) and animal names. Andriel continuously use verbal communications to request and ask for help. Andriel keeps hugging his mum and dad while saying “I yab you” (from ayayoo). There are instances where Andriel is speaking Filipino (Tagalog) utterances despite us not communicating with him in that medium. As he expands his vocabulary, he is also mixing words and getting confused from time to time. We’re working on this by making sure that Andriel should be confident on what to say, instead of “just guessing.”  🧠 Psychologist / Behaviour Therapy #  We continue teaching Andriel on how to control his emotions (Angry / Happy / Sad). These days there isn’t a lot of frustration (biting / scratching) compared before. Andriel is improving in terms of recognising emotions of others around him (parents)  🚴‍♀️ Occupational Therapy #  Andriel is doing well in terms of sitting for a period of time to perform activities. We continue working on gross and fine motor skills. We’re currently working on Andriel’s capability to further improve his focus and listening skills. We do this by “adding up” more steps to activities that he likes. For example: stepping on coloured tiles where he has to “stop” / “go” / “go to… Red” His gross motor skills are improving further as he was able to carry heavier objects, close the doors properly, and climb even higher grounds. We’re continuously working on his writing skills as part of school readiness. Right now, he can write in most directions (up / down / left / right) with minimal supervision.  Pre-schools # 🌈 SDN Beranga (Autism Specific) #  Andriel shows high interests in gross motor activities. He is very confident with his climbing skills that he would go up the monkey bars.      Andriel continues to explore various activities such as painting, play doughs, exploring food. For the next couple of months, all of these sit down “focus” plays are the focus for Andriel.        🦋 Papilio Ingleburn (Mainstream) #  The educators’ observation is that Andriel always prefer to be alone. In the coming weeks and months, they will continue to encourage Andriel to join group activities. He does listen to instructions such as going to the toilet / time to eat / go home.     🪜 Primary Schools #  All documents are submitted to Austral Public School and we’ll just be waiting for further assessments / requirements. Unfortunately, a lot of catholic schools doesn’t offer support classes; and they didn’t consider Andriel for a placement next year. We’re still in the process of applying to Aspect Macarthur. We missed the application for Mater Dei this year, but we’re on the wait list for openings this year or the next.   🏡Home and Family Activities # Home Updates #  Toileting. He consistently didn’t have any accident in the past 2 weeks. There are also instances when Andriel prompts us that he wants to go to the toilet for a poop. Toileting is now part of his daily routine that he holds it off, until he gets to a toilet. Last night he wasn’t even wearing a nappy at sleep! Dentist. Andriel is scheduled to do his dental surgery this month. We’ll keep you posted on how it will go. Home Therapies. We continue to work with Andriel to improve his skills on all aspects. It is very evident that he is learning a lot these days, and you can see the effort from him as well. From iPad apps to sit down activities, Andriel shows improvement on a lot of things. Lately, he’ve mastered numeracy of “1 to 10”. Going out. Whenever we go out for either groceries or shopping, Andriel will always hold his dad’s hand. He is becoming aware of being supervised and would actually initiate holding hands whenever he is walking. Self awareness. I think Andriel is becoming more “self aware” about what’s happening around him. Whenever we play videos of him (like teaching him ABCs), he would look at it and he would also follow it. He is also very opinionated now whenever we ask him what he likes in terms of food, toys, and activities.  📸 Photos and Activities # Andriel mastering numeracy.

Andriel is almost accurate with his \u0026ldquo;Yeah\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Nah\u0026rdquo; where they are more in context and appropriate. Beth and the family have worked on turn taking and it\u0026rsquo;s showing progress as Andriel learns to wait. Andriel can now recite most letters of the alphabet with the most difficulty on \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; sounds. The other words such as \u0026ldquo;Bore\u0026rdquo; (more), Upey (Up), Hepy (Help), \u0026ldquo;Ayayoo\u0026rdquo; (I love you) are also very appropriate these past few weeks. Andriel continues to immitate the last syllable of someone\u0026rsquo;s words.  🧠 Psychologist / Behaviour Therapy #  Andriel started seein Ben (Psychologist) from Cross Care to work on his behaviour. Ben created a cognitive report for Andriel. It should be available this week. Let me know if you need it. We started working on Andriel\u0026rsquo;s recognition of emotions such as: Happy, Angry, and Sad.  We use the iPad to learn from pictures.   Andriel have shown to learn the meaning of Angry and can demonstrate the gesture. Lately, he tends to think twice before resulting into pinching, scratching, and biting.  🚴‍♀️ Occupational Therapy #  👋🏼 Andriel said goodbye to Alex (OT) from Cross Care.  Where we left of, Andriel was focusing on the use of Spoon, Fork, Tongs, and other utencils. Alex also worked on pencil grips to draw lines, letters, and shapes.   👀 Andriel is now seeing Priya from Kids Therapy (Austral).  We had our first assessment and made her up to speed with all the awesome things that\u0026rsquo;s happening within Andriel.   We\u0026rsquo;ll continue working on the different aspects of \u0026ldquo;School Readiness\u0026rdquo; throughout the year.  Pre-schools # 🌈 SDN Beranga (Autism Specific) # We had our planning session with the key educator, and we\u0026rsquo;ve established these goals.\n Focus Time. Andriel tends to get distracted most of the time, and having to sit in a chair for extended hour is a challenge. We want to improve it. Expressive Skills. We want to empower Andriel to let him express what he needs and wants by giving him opportunities to speak or request appropriately. School readiness. This topic is broad, but having an understanding of \u0026ldquo;where things should be\u0026rdquo; is the primary focus. General safety such as following stop instructions.  SDN continues to observe Andriel and finds the following:\n Participates in food play activities Actively using toilets Participates in puzzle activities Andriel tends to climb and jump on high grounds. Reports available. Let me know if you need it.  🦋 Papilio Ingleburn (Mainstream) #  Participates in some activities (mostly solo). Actively using toilets. Andriel tends to listen to his educators specially when being called out. Andriel tends to climb and jump on high grounds.     🪜 Primary Schools # We\u0026rsquo;ve spent a lot of time lately in applying to different schools around Austral (South-West) area.\n Our preferred school for Andriel is Aspect Macarthur.  We\u0026rsquo;ve submitted most documents and just waiting for: Cognitive report (Ben) and Up to date diagnosis (Geoffrey) We are waiting for Andriel\u0026rsquo;s next Paediatrician (Geoffrey) appointment this May to have an up to date diagnosis for Andriel.   Catholic Schools  We\u0026rsquo;ve applied to various catholic schools around the area. Some schools doesn\u0026rsquo;t have support for special / support classes. Some are in the process and just waiting for their Diverse Learning coordinator.   Austral Public School.  We\u0026rsquo;ve submitted all documents and enrollment forms. Robyn from Department of Education have also submitted her reports. We\u0026rsquo;re just waiting for next steps.     🏡Home and Family Activities # Home Updates #   House. The last rental place in Ingleburn had a lot of water trouble and we have moved to a new rental place in Leumeah, NSW (Campbeltown). We\u0026rsquo;ve secured a lot in Austral, NSW. We\u0026rsquo;re in the process of finalising our house plans and ETA of completion is around January 2023. If all goes well, Andriel will start his Primary school in Austral.\n  Toileting. Andriel doesn\u0026rsquo;t use nappies anymore on day times. He tends to go for a \u0026ldquo;Wee\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Poo\u0026rdquo; when prompted to go to the toilet. Sometimes he shows gestures of discomfort, and we proceed to go to the toilet. We will keep doing this for the next few weeks, then we\u0026rsquo;ll also try to remove nappies at night time as we need more observation for this. In the near future, we want him to be more expressive and inform us when he needs to go.\n  Dentists. The family had a general check-up of our teeth since Covid. The good thing is that Andriel didn\u0026rsquo;t throw a tantrum throughout the session: when the dentist said \u0026ldquo;AHHH\u0026rdquo;, he would open his mouth. Unfortunately, Andriel have a lot of broken teeth that needs fixing as it\u0026rsquo;s too early for him to lose a lot of teeth. He was referred to a specialist and we found out that he needs a dental surgery (with sedation) to fix those teeth. It\u0026rsquo;s currently scheduled on May 19th.\n      Home Therapies. We continue his \u0026ldquo;training\u0026rdquo; and development at home. The parents make sure that he gets at least 30 minutes 1-on-1 everyday to work on his goals. We are focusing on expressive skills, turn takings and pen activities. We also noticed that on his limited screen times, he tends to interact (mimicing words) with the songs that he listens lately.        📸 Photos and Activities # The past few weeks are mostly raining but on the days that are sunny, we tend to have fun outdoors. On these days, we also make sure to give Andriel the opportunity to express himself from asking him to \u0026ldquo;where is the dog?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;are you hungry?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;toilet?\u0026rdquo;\n         Andriel was able to observe people screaming from the ride, and shows a form of \u0026ldquo;mimicking\u0026rdquo; and felt the excitement of other people.\n   On some days when it\u0026rsquo;s a rainy weekend, we find places where Andriel can still have fun indoors. His favourite is Flip Out. Andriel was jumping, running, and climbing for almost 2 hours straight! He\u0026rsquo;s so happy seeing a lot of people around him jumping.\n      We expose him to movie theatres to practice being in a community; and Andriel have shown focus on movies that is appealing to him like Sonic the Hedgehog. He was able to sit down for the duration of the movie and didn\u0026rsquo;t cause a lot of noise. The other movie on the other hand (Fantastic Beast) is a different story.\n    ⏭️ What\u0026rsquo;s coming and Notes from Parents? #  It\u0026rsquo;s a boy! Andriel will become a big brother soon. He tends to rub and kiss mum\u0026rsquo;s belly these days.       We are currently limiting Andriel\u0026rsquo;s sugar intake, and people might see some changes in his mood.\n  If you have any questions or comments, feel free to message us.\n  ","date":"9 April 2022","permalink":"/blog/andriel-newsletter14/","section":"Blogs","summary":"📰 What\u0026rsquo;s New?","title":"Andriel's Newsletter no. 14"},{"content":"A couple of weeks ago, I started a campaign to raise money into my Run For Autism 2021. Long story short, I made it! Raising the money, running the distance, and raising more awareness. It\u0026rsquo;s been a challenging journey given I experienced a lot of adversaries along the way.\nHere are some of the key takeaways of this journey: - Always define the purpose - Set realistic expectations - Love the process - Deliver what you\u0026rsquo;ve committed - Know when to rest\nAlways define the purpose # There are many reasons to participate in an event. Whether that\u0026rsquo;s just pure hype or the cause is personal to you, there is a reason \u0026ldquo;why.\u0026rdquo; That why is very important. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be your fuel when things get tough, and when you\u0026rsquo;re not sure why you\u0026rsquo;re still doing something.\nMy why for this cause is because of my son and wife. They are both in the spectrum, and this is a topic that I deeply care about. My son was diagnosed at an early age, and has changed me (and the people around me) forever. I became more open with the world around me, and how people are both unique and similar.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not just doing this for myself. When the weight of a cause is larger than yourself, the motivation also gets bigger. The stakes are also higher, but there is a notion that \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not just you.\u0026rdquo; There is a support backing you. Whether through money or motivation, the purpose kindles your spirit throughout the journey.\nSet realistic expectations # Right from the beginning, I\u0026rsquo;ve set some expectations on to myself and to others on what I want to achieve out of this. I am not aiming for any world record or even a personal best. The parameters were clear that I am aiming to raise the money (777 AUD) and cover the distance (49 KM). I was also aiming not to get injured along the journey, that\u0026rsquo;s why the speed wasn\u0026rsquo;t very important for me. I approached this reasonably, and without fooling myself.\nThis is very important, because having unrealistic goals will often break your spirit when you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of it. When the finish line seems so far, and you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re not getting there, you will have the tendency to abandon it. On the other hand, there is also no point of setting a \u0026ldquo;very easy\u0026rdquo; goal that you can just finish straight away - as this brings boredom and not challenge. The key is to aim for something you haven\u0026rsquo;t done, but you know that given the right time, effort, and resources - is achievable.\nLove the process # Any venture that you do in life, whether that\u0026rsquo;s starting a business or starting a career - you should always love the process. You don\u0026rsquo;t just look after passing the finish line, you don\u0026rsquo;t just expect to graduate tomorrow, you don\u0026rsquo;t just expect results by doing small effort. As we keep on saying \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s about the journey, and not the destination.\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp; \u0026ldquo;learn to smell the flowers\u0026rdquo; are very true.\nI know that running 49 KM will be boring, so I had to be a little creative about it. I packed myself with a lot of audiobooks and podcasts that are in my backlog for quite some time now. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised that I actually immersed with the content, and felt like \u0026ldquo;learning while suffering\u0026rdquo;. Not to be a masochist, but sometimes we need a little physical pain in order to keep our minds in tact and sharp.\nMy goal is not to just run 49 KM and stop next week. My goal is to have a healthier lifestyle and become a lifelong running. The experience is meditative on my end, and will continue to be part of my system. Results are just byproducts of your love on to the process. Today, it\u0026rsquo;s about this challenge, next month it\u0026rsquo;s about something else - but the process is still the same.\nDeliver what you\u0026rsquo;ve committed # Unfortunately, I had my very first gout attack (left foot toe) in my life. The timing couldn\u0026rsquo;t be any less perfect, as it\u0026rsquo;s the time I have to do this journey. It could have been easy to just do 7 KM run everyday for 7 days, but halfway through, I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk properly. My foot is sore and there is extreme pain every 4AM.\nAlthough, nothing serious at this point, this was a major setback on my plans. The pain was at its worst on the first 2 days. I really felt like giving up on the cause and just forget about it. However, I realized that this is just a setback, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t really define the outcome. So I took proper rests, and on the last 2 days, I ran 14 KM each day - covering all the remaining deficits. When you don\u0026rsquo;t really fulfill your promise, your words become meaningless. People will trust you less. This key lesson is also very important when you\u0026rsquo;re raising capital or convincing a client on \u0026ldquo;why you.\u0026rdquo;\nKnow when to rest # This journey wasn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;full time job\u0026rdquo; or 100% focus on my end. I have to continue working and make sure that I also fulfill my family duties and prior commitments. This allowed me to be smarter with my time. I use the running time to process or solve some of the problems that I face at work. I also took better care of my mental health, as I know when to pivot and move on to the next thing. I had 2 types of rests during this journey.\nThe physical rest that I make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t get fatigue, I get enough sleep, and nutrition. This activity is very exhausting and you would really feel the numbness and sore of your feet at night. Doing the basics is always the best - no need to overcomplicate. Enough sleep, eat right, and maintain your stress level.\nThen the other one is the spiritual rest. This is more important, as this allowed me to stay on track on things. I am still very new to mindful meditation, but this really helped me a lot to make sure I am on top of things. Writing and journaling also helped me a lot in this process, as it allowed me to just flow through my thoughts and ideas into words.\n\u0026ndash;\nOverall, it was indeed a challenging but at the same time fun experience. I would definitely do it again next year (with higher stakes). This won\u0026rsquo;t be possible without my wife, my son, my family, and my friends. I am very fortunate that I experienced this journey!\n","date":"8 November 2021","permalink":"/blog/run-for-autism-2021/","section":"Blogs","summary":"A couple of weeks ago, I started a campaign to raise money into my Run For Autism 2021.","title":"Run for Autism - 2021"},{"content":"The most scarce resource is your time and attention.

It will help you a lot in your career if you learn “how to learn”; and reading effectively is one principle that you have to understand and practice too.\nThe problems that most people had is that they wanted “to read a book” and not “become a reader” and there is a big difference. Reading should be a lifestyle of choice, rather than a medium to consume just a specific topic. It’s unfortunate that less and fewer people are inclined in to reading, because of the abundance of short-lived social media contents.

Most days, I\u0026rsquo;d rather stay alone and be in my world to get things done. I found in the past that the effort to collaborate is counterintuitive and would just mean more work for me. Back then, I\u0026rsquo;d rather do things \u0026ldquo;my way\u0026rdquo; than to delegate so that I don\u0026rsquo;t get disappointed with the results from someone else. These have changed because I finally found the right sweet spot on this. It\u0026rsquo;s called an accountability partner.\nWhatever you\u0026rsquo;re working on, find someone else whom you can share accountability for it. I have a big emphasis on sharing because it\u0026rsquo;s different from \u0026ldquo;passing down\u0026rdquo; all the work. There is a difference between collaborating with your colleagues or an employer delegating to an employee. It means that you and that partner (or peers) are both motivated by the successful outcome of the work. You\u0026rsquo;re not doing it because \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s part of your job\u0026rdquo; to work together. I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that the true power of collaboration is when not only one person is invested in it.\nJust like in The Battle of Clouds podcast, I have Bryan, whom I work with, to make sure we don\u0026rsquo;t get de-motivated on publishing (we do from time to time). We keep reminding each other about what is the next thing to do. We also learn from our episodes by collaborating and having different perspectives and ideas. If we also feel like not recording on that day, we then share the burden of not having to deliver. Our goal to the project is to become a lifelong learner, and this is just a means for that. We don\u0026rsquo;t expect to become millionaires from this podcast, all right, to become a regular radio pod casters “nerding out” technology topics. :)\nWe\u0026rsquo;re currently building a house and must undergo the end-to-end journey of it. As many would know, the process is very tedious and stressful. I share the responsibility and accountability of this with my wife. From choosing colors, designs, electrical ports; it gets daunting to just think about all the variations. Although her effort is much more than I do, often, we discuss what we want and what we don\u0026rsquo;t like - and we meet halfway. We are still in the early phase of the build, but we want to make sure that we set ourselves up for success. This is a big financial decision that we are both accounted for.\nWith all the startup ventures I\u0026rsquo;m involved with, I have at least one partner to collaborate and bounce ideas within. As much as I have hundreds of product ideas to work on, I know I will get de-motivated with it eventually and will just abandon the project. I need to keep on working towards shared goals. Having someone to peer-review your ideas and work would help you have an excellent product market fit. Sometimes what you think is great is not really that novel for someone else. You\u0026rsquo;re building products not for yourself, but to solve other people\u0026rsquo;s problems.\nThe problem with modern \u0026ldquo;tasks\u0026rdquo; management is that all deadlines are just imaginary. There is no such thing as \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s done tomorrow\u0026rdquo;, because we\u0026rsquo;re living in a world where things are becoming increasingly \u0026ldquo;asynchronous.\u0026rdquo; Asynchronous means we keep waiting for others to finish, before we can build on top of it, hence we perform things that someone on the other line is waiting for. Having an accountability partner allows you to move forward synchronously and take a solid path towards your combined goals. Also, as funny as it may sound, \u0026ldquo;peer pressure\u0026rdquo; is real and we rarely want to disappoint people- \u0026ldquo;the guilt is enough to keep you moving.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"13 September 2021","permalink":"/blog/accountability-partner/","section":"Blogs","summary":"For the longest of time, I would consider myself as the lone wolf at work.","title":"Productive this Pandemic - Accountability Partner"},{"content":"The workplace has transformed in the last 2 years because of the pandemic.

Still, not everyone knows it, but the most important resource in this world is your time and attention. It\u0026rsquo;s something that you should be really protective of. Not to be overly morbid, but your time here in this world is limited and we\u0026rsquo;ll all die someday. You can choose a digital calendar and all the fancy integrations and interfaces; or a generic physical calendar is enough. What’s important is a medium and system that works for you, and you would actively see and maintain.\nPlanning # I spend an hour of my Sunday to plan what to do for the week ahead. I plan what are the meetings that I should attend to and which ones I will \u0026ldquo;politely say No.\u0026rdquo; I inform people what I\u0026rsquo;m planning to work on the week ahead and what they expect from me to deliver. In this planning, I also block portions of my calendar to work on the core tasks for the week that I need to find at least an hour to do.\nBy blocking time in your calendar, you commit to yourself that you are going to do it. If you’re using a digital calendar, this will also be reflective on your team\u0026rsquo;s calendar, showing that you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;busy\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;away\u0026rdquo;. People won\u0026rsquo;t just randomly set-up a meeting with you to \u0026ldquo;talk about something.\u0026rdquo; I know not workplace respects these concepts and \u0026ldquo;everything is urgent\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;I want it done\u0026hellip; NOW!\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;re working in that environment where people don\u0026rsquo;t respect (or abuse) your attention and time, then it is not a very healthy one.\n   If something else gets prioritised, let\u0026rsquo;s say some production issues or emergency meetings, then it gets clearer for you and everyone else involved in why you weren\u0026rsquo;t able to accomplish X. You then move those work chunks into another time of the day or the week.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re going to work on that side project or side hustle, put it in your calendar. If it\u0026rsquo;s not in your calendar, don\u0026rsquo;t do it or not even think about it while doing your major work or spending time with family. The problem is sometimes we expect things just to happen in front of us while forgetting that we have to spend the time to accomplish things. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to say \u0026ldquo;If only I did this, I would have been that\u0026rdquo;, but you didn\u0026rsquo;t really put the time and even the slightest effort into doing it. Planning helps you get your odds higher for success.\nThis also applies to personal events in life: doctor appointments, driving, cooking, groceries, running, journaling, playing with your kid at \u0026ldquo;full attention,\u0026rdquo; house planning, etc. The same principle applies. If you\u0026rsquo;re committed to doing it, it should be in your calendar. I understand I need to play with my kid as he needs support and guidance growing up. That is important to me, so I make sure I put it on my calendar and no one else can take that time away.\nSummary # A lot of these ventures, projects, and tasks, especially as a knowledge worker, don\u0026rsquo;t have deadlines. Most of them are just imaginary and it\u0026rsquo;s just living on someone else\u0026rsquo; mind as she/he assesses risks. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to get demotivated, distracted, and demoralised to achieve your goals. This is indeed a challenging time, and there it\u0026rsquo;s OK not to be OK. Getting yourself equipped with these different techniques and mental models will help you focus on what\u0026rsquo;s really important.\n","date":"4 September 2021","permalink":"/blog/planning-your-week-ahead/","section":"Blogs","summary":"People have asked me lately, how do I do it?","title":"Productive this Pandemic - Planning your week ahead"},{"content":"I’ve had a love and hate relationship with social media platforms in the past decade.

Traditionally, a user interface can directly call a backend service, and then that backend service goes straight in to inserting a record to a database. But that was like decades ago. Since then, a lot of improvements already happened. Messaging came to the rescue in order to handle millions and billions of concurrent transactions happening around. Imagine if you have millions of users of your application and would push messages all over the place. Your database and backend processing services won’t be able to do it.\nA lot of these are now managed via cloud natives services. There are so many variations now depending on which use case are you looking at. However, there are still a lot of use case for local or bare metal implementation of this. This is where Kafka and RabbitMQ shine. They do support various topologies or techniques, such as Pub/Sub, Fan-Out, Streaming, and a lot more.

The term hybrid has grown too in the last couple of years. It used to be just the connectivity between an on-premises data center to public clouds like AWS and Azure. This time, hybrid now also includes multi-cloud and edge computing. It\u0026rsquo;s about borderless connectivity across different topologies or deployment models happening around.\nWhy hybrid cloud? # To answer the most important question: Why hybrid cloud? The answer is really simple, not all apps and data should be on 1 public cloud.\nTo give you a better understanding of how it will all make sense, let\u0026rsquo;s travel back in time around 2011 / 2012 when public cloud like AWS and Azure are just getting mainstream adoption.\nOn-Premise Infrastructure #    A lot of companies, especially big enterprise ones in the past, have physical racks of servers. The company owns the hardware and comes with high capital to set up their IT infrastructure and operations. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about hundreds of thousands (even millions) of dollars of capital and operations expense in order to have robust databases and applications. Companies have dedicated System Operations team that are not fully embedded with developers. DevOps and infrastructure as a code are not yet a thing. Developers are really just coding, it is someone else\u0026rsquo; problem to package it and make sure it runs on servers.\nThen public cloud happened. Some startups could start natively on cloud without the baggage of legacy infrastructure. When the dawn of AWS and Azure came along, a lot of these companies weren\u0026rsquo;t able to just \u0026ldquo;lift and shift\u0026rdquo; to the public cloud.They adopted a \u0026ldquo;hybrid\u0026rdquo; approach like most critical workloads are still on-premise and some are deployed in public cloud. The common pattern was putting the public facing web application on a public cloud to cater the elastic scale while the crucial and sensitive data still lives on-premises.\nAzure Virtualization #    Virtualization is a key component of both public cloud and hybrid cloud. This technology allowed companies to spin up multiple virtual machines, but the resource allocation would only take minutes instead of days or months because of the physical procurement of the device. Even before public cloud became popular, big enterprise companies already adopt a virtualize environment to manage their high performance servers. Hyper-V is one of the biggest player in this space, specially when you are working on a Windows Server and SQL Server environment. With Hyper-V, you can create virtual machines on the fly using your servers. That is why, when big enterprises moved to Azure, most of the approaches and underlying infrastructure are also leveraged. Automation scripts written in PowerShell were also re-purposed for public cloud.\nIn order to bridge this gap for enterprises to adopt hybrid, the common approach is to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network). The technology is not new, as this is also the same approach companies used when performing multi-region operations across their data centres. This time, it\u0026rsquo;s just another point-to-point connectivity from one infrastructure to the public cloud. This private connection allows you to expose specific data, application, and ports of your on-premise infrastructure securely to the public cloud without them being accessible to the public internet. Microsoft Azure offers this type of service with VPN Gateway.\nMicrosoft Azure also offers a premium service called Express Route that allows you to set up a dedicated network connection between your data centre and an Azure data centre for faster and more stable latency. Then inside your Azure resources, you can establish secured networks using Azure Virtual Networks so that only specific resources are bound to communicate with each other. Not because a resource is in \u0026ldquo;public cloud\u0026rdquo;, it can be accessed by everyone using the public network. The very early use cases of these were protecting database servers to ensure that only application servers can communicate to it. Since then, the networking components paradigm and policies of Azure have developed.\nAzure Containers #    The virtualization space has been disrupted these past few years because of containers (Docker) and Kubernetes. Unlike Virtual Machines, where you have an \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; (often enormous) that you can deploy and virtualize across your hypervisor (like Hyper-V) or like Azure VM Scalesets. This time around, you can package your application and \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; all the underlying application dependencies as a container. You will now then be able to run this container to an orchestrator where the underlying infrastructure mechanisms such as networking and elasticity (scaling) are easily managed - such as Kubernetes. Think of a more traditional .NET app on IIS and .NET runtime on Windows Server can now easily be packaged into a container deployed to Kubernetes straight away without having IIS Configuration Manager.\nMicrosoft Azure offers a lot in this space. Without detailing, these are the primary services that you can use:\n Azure Kubernetes Services: managed Kubernetes orchestrator. Azure Container Instances: deploy a container in a running instance straight away. Azure Container Registries: general purpose storage of containers. App Services for Containers: similar to ACI, but leverages App Service Plan.  How this relates to Hybrid are:\n  It\u0026rsquo;s relatively easier to migrate (or co-deploy) a container from one orchestrator service to another. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying it\u0026rsquo;s going to work on day 1, but the transition and compatibility are easier. A container from one managed Kubernetes cluster can easily be deployed to an on-premise Kubernetes cluster and vice versa.\n  You do more abstraction on the underlying infrastructure and platform, and focus on your application. In the future, most of these would probably just be toggle buttons or configuration settings that you can enable and disable.\n  Scaling infrastructure has always been a trivial thing to do. There is no easy way to scale applications. Of course, you can always just \u0026ldquo;beef-up\u0026rdquo; the servers and buy more resources. However, other than costs, you also have to consider the maintainability and reliability of the services. Containers made it relatively \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; manageable.\n  Multi-cloud #    As the race in public cloud continues, these companies are becoming much more competitive with the services that are available and the pricing model that they offer. Although in my honest opinion it\u0026rsquo;s hard to beat these public clouds in terms of service reliability like (99.999% and 99.99%), they still experience outage from time to time. This brings to the concept of \u0026ldquo;Cloud Gravity\u0026rdquo;. Cloud Gravity is when you build apps and services on top of a specific cloud provider, you then become more glued to the infrastructure that moving to a different provider is not very seamless. This comes with technology fatigue when, instead of focusing on the business requirements and application logic, you become tied in to what the public cloud service offers. The developers and infrastructure engineer have to learn things that are just specific for that vendor.\nThat is why the emergence of a multi-cloud strategy came to be. Some companies don\u0026rsquo;t bet on just one cloud provider, they utilise multiple cloud providers on various operations and workloads. Some common observations I had in the past are having AWS for public facing apps, Azure for enterprise apps, data warehousing \u0026amp; analytics, and Active Directory / Office 365 integrations; and Google Cloud for AI \u0026amp; Machine Learning. Obviously, most of the services offered by these providers have parallels and often have a lot of overlaps.\nHowever, setting up for a multi-cloud strategy is complex and requires a lot of resources. Teams need to be up-skilled in various technologies and platforms. The account relationship between vendors is also something to consider. As the services and platforms of these public clouds are also moving at a rapid pace, that also means your teams should be able to sustain that pace.\nEdge Infrastructure #    In recent years, there is an increased adoption of edge devices. I know this for a fact, because this has been what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on for at least 2 years now. With the rise of Machine Learning and IoT, the need for centralized infrastructure (public cloud and on-premise data centre) is becoming more prevalent. One of the common use cases that I worked on is with Video Analytics. You have a stream of video files across your CCTV and IP Cameras. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t transmit all of those video feeds to the public cloud because it\u0026rsquo;s expensive and slow (at least for now). The idea approach is to have a server that is good enough to process the streaming and the ML models to do inferences. The telemetries from that inference (like object detection) would then be sent to the public cloud, such as an Azure IoT Hub.\nThere are a lot of activities happening here, from the public cloud providers like (Azure, AWS, Google) to a bunch of IoTs device manufactures. Some are more managed wherein the device sends data to the provider, and you just consume an API, some are bare metals where you can choose what can be in it. Microsoft Azure offers a lot in this IoT and Compute on Edge space:\nAzure on Edge - High Compute #     Azure Stack HCI: a standalone Azure on your premises. Azure Stack Hub: on-premises extensions of Azure public cloud. Azure Stack Edge: acts as storage and gateway to Azure.  Azure on Edge - Portable #     Azure Percept: full stack platform to cover AI on edge. This is good for prototyping your machine learning and computer visions in a fully managed package. Azure Sphere: secured platform with built-in security features for internet-connected devices. This is not a device that Microsoft produces, but a standard that chip manufacturers can adopt to make sure that when devices connect to the internet, they are secured. 3rd party IoT devices like Arduino suites can also connect to Azure through IoT Hub and installing the IoT Edge runtime on to it.  As you have more infrastructure and connected devices in place, it gets more complicated to manage. Good thing is that a lot of these edge servers now also support an orchestrator like Kubernetes in order to manage application containers easily. If you\u0026rsquo;re operating in a low connectivity environment such as ship vessels, mining sites, airplanes, you can now leverage technologies such as managed applications and databases that are enclave and within the perimeter of that environment. As well as useful telemetries and semi-structured data can seamlessly be transmitted over the public cloud, where the more complex and high-intensity computations can be processed. It is indeed revolutionizing the traditional \u0026ldquo;embedded\u0026rdquo; software on hardware into a more intelligent hardware infrastructure.\nAzure Arc #    In the future (and today), what companies will end up is having multiple diverse infrastructure in place such as virtual machines on public cloud, virtual machines on-premise data centres, edge infrastructure, managed Kubernetes on public cloud, and managed services across places. You\u0026rsquo;ll have public facing applications on public cloud, some regional data centres for data warehousing, edge infrastructure on remote offices and operations, and a bunch of connected IoT devices. Now how are you going to manage the policies across all of them? That\u0026rsquo;s where a service like Microsoft Arc comes in to place.\nMicrosoft Arc allows you to have a single pane of glass for monitoring all of your resources wherever they are sitting. You can leverage policies and standards that you\u0026rsquo;ve already set up for your Azure resources, this time extending them to non-Azure (public cloud) resources. Azure also allows you to implement RBAC (Role Based Access Controls) to govern who have access to which resources. Probably the best reason to use Azure Arc is the ability to enable connectivity across various resources. Think of it in the future where you don\u0026rsquo;t have to manage the underlying infrastructure to connect disparate resources and they will just be connected under the hood. Currently, Microsoft Arc supports servers, Kubernetes, and soon Managed Services (SQL, Serverless, etc).\n   Hybrid cloud and Edge are the things that I\u0026rsquo;m really into right now. This will be my focus for the next few years to come.\nSummary # Microsoft Azure allows you to have a flexibility of your infrastructure:\n On-premises Multi-Cloud Edge  Many companies are now adopting a multi-cloud strategy.\nEdge infrastructure allows you to run remote operations with high performance hardware.\nAzure arc allows you to centralize the management of your hybrid infrastructure.\nResources #  What is Hybrid Cloud?

It’s about protecting something, either that is you, your family, or properties against unwanted scenarios. This applies to a lot of different domains such as in physical properties like your home and workplace, and as well as in your digital life, such as computers, software, banking systems, and so on.\nDepending on which domain, there are also different levels and approaches to security. Most of the time, the security aspect of things are concentrated on people’s malicious intents. These intents are mostly around theft, privacy, and exploits. As we say, there is no perfect system. You can only protect what you know and currently understand. That’s why it’s important to invest in it proactively.\nThroughout the years, this space has developed because the different level of threats and techniques in breaking barriers are also growing. This is a never-ending cycle as things progress throughout the years. There will be more exploits or hacking that will happen, and more security standards and protocols will be applied.

One of the hurdles I encountered in the past is that some tooling and frameworks were not first class citizens on Windows. Majority of these tools, especially those that come with scripts and complex networking architecture (circa 2015) just works in MacOS and Linux:Ubuntu.\nIntroduction # Of course there have been a lot of improvements now in the ecosystem since then. A lot of the workflow now will just work natively on Windows or there are a lot of binding libraries or wrappers that can interop with. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Windows, there are a lot of options for virtualisation of Linux such as Virtualbox, Hyper-V, VMware Fusion, and much more. Running Linux virtual machines on cloud such as Microsoft Azure is also an option.\nBut what\u0026rsquo;s interesting now is that Windows 10 comes with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2) that actually allows you to work with Linux without having to start / stop a VM. This flexibility allows you to still use Windows 10 as your primary OS and connect to a Linux instance, just like doing a remote ssh session. There are many reasons on why you would still want to use Windows as your primary OS, but for me it\u0026rsquo;s more around Microsoft Office productivity and my preferred OS in developing .NET apps - then WSL2 all the way.\nSo going back to Blockchain development on WSL2, there are a lot of things that actually work for my workflow without having too much friction and context switching. Below is the high-level \u0026ldquo;at a glance\u0026rdquo; image of how I set up my machine.\n   Visual Studio Code # VSCode is arguably the most preferred IDE in the past years for a lot of reasons. The main one for me is the abundance of extensions and community support with this beauty. It\u0026rsquo;s now more than just a text editor that comes with a shell, it\u0026rsquo;s an entire ecosystem of developer tools. I install this on Windows mainly because I want to standardise my settings, extensions, themes, and other configurations \u0026ldquo;whatever\u0026rdquo; I work on. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s .NET on Windows , ASP.NET + React on Windows or Solidity on WSL2, I have a single key mapping for all of them.\nThese are the extensions I install that are related to Blockchain:\n  Remote Development Extensions\n  Solidity \u0026amp; Solidity Visual Developer\n  Other programming languages support for Java, Go, Haskell, Rust, etc.\n  Docker\n  Prettier, Linting, Themes, Fonts, and other UI personalization.\n  Smart Contracts Development # Solidity # I\u0026rsquo;m guessing 90% of the smart contracts right now are written in Solidity. I\u0026rsquo;m also guessing that 90% of blockchain projects are using a flavour of Ethereum. With that in mind, if you choose to develop smart contracts using Solidity, it would work in WSL2.\nSolidity as a language is very similar to JavaScript in terms of ease of use. It gets some time to be familiar with the syntax and semantics. But one thing for sure is that it\u0026rsquo;s a fast-grown programming language. You will notice as you develop contracts, the solc compiler version gets updated frequently.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re new to the language, you can probably just go straight to any web browser and open https://remix.ethereum.org to get started. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t require WSL2 or any installed dependency.\nThere are many ways to compile Solidity, such as using Docker (ethereum/solc) or install solc into wsl2 using apt-get, snap, or homebrew. There are also options to install it using the static C/C++ libraries. Depending on your appetite of depth and requirements, then you have a lot of options.\nThe common pattern right now is to use JavaScript libraries for end to end compilation, testing, and migrations. There are also a lot of popular libraries out there that you can piggyback on, such as OpenZepplin and Uniswap. More about compiler options below.\nVyper # The only alternative to solidity right now is Vyper. As the name provokes, it comes with the Python family. Vyper allows you to write smart contracts using Python. Some would argue that Python is the easiest programming language to learn and the most popular one right now. Installing Vyper (and Python) is as simple as just installing Python on Linux. This would work straight away with WSL2 as well as pip.\nAnother thing worth mentioning with Python on Ethereum is Brownie. Brownie is a testing framework that allows you to test and mock your smart contracts using Python. Brownie would also work even if your smart contracts are written in Solidity.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not yet sold on moving to Vyper as the majority of the ecosystem and community at large are still in Solidity, specially those contracts that are already peer-reviewed and battle tested. But it\u0026rsquo;s always good to have an alternative option!\nJavaScript \u0026amp; Typescript # One thing I really like about working on Node.js project is NVM (Node Version Manager). Although there is a port of this in Windows, the projects in Linux and Mac are actively maintained. NVM allows you to install multiple versions of Node.js and can easily update and switch versions whenever specific libraries target specific versions.\nI also prefer Yarn for package management. Although the preference is always subjective, in my experience, yarn just cuts it when dealing with complex dependency trees and relative install time. Also, the shortcuts are superb like yb for yarn build and yt for yarn test which are all just simple aliases and key-mapping that I setup in by shell.\nOnce Node.js is installed, you can run most of the blockchain projects on the project scope. You have the options to install tools globally, but I prefer to keep node packages to its project level - again, preference.\nOnce you go to the JavaScript world of blockchain, there are now so many variations and libraries you can use. You also have a plethora of choice on which SPA (Single Page Apps) would you like to use: React, Vue, Angular, and the list goes on. However, when interfacing with smart contracts, these are the usual stack that you can use when building, testing, and deploying to different networks:\nTruffle, web3.js, and Ganache # Back when I started smart contracts development in 2017, this was probably the only known option back then.\nweb3.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to interface with deployed contracts.\nGanache is your instant local blockchain environment.\nTruffle allows you to compile, test, and deploy contracts.\nGiven its dominance in the market, it comes with other tools that might help you with developing smart contracts such as Boxes and Drizzle.\nHardhat, ethers.js and Waffle # This stack is now becoming popular in recent months.\nethers.js is very similar to web3.js. It allows you to interface with deployed contracts.\nHardhat is very similar to Truffle, that allows you to compile, test, and deploy contracts. It also allows you to have an instance blockchain like Ganache.\nWaffle is a good extension to Hardhat in order to make testing smart contracts more fun.\nBoth of them could also be extended to use advanced testing techniques like Mocha \u0026amp; Chai. I could probably write a separate blog post that outlines the difference of these two stacks, but on WSL2 perspective, using them would just work, just like any node.js project.\nOne advantage of using JavaScript/TypeScript in your smart contract development is the wide ecosystem around it. Obviously, the whole NPM package registry has exploded!\nNon-JS flavours # Obviously, there are also a lot of novel approach in doing blockchain DApp (Decentralised App) development other than Ethereum. Although this is seldom in my experience, they exist:\n  Cardano\n  R3 Corda\n  Hyperledger Fabric\n  Most of them are something you can set up with Docker or install natively on Linux, in this case WSL2. Depending on which programming languages they support in writing smart contracts, it\u0026rsquo;s most likely that there is a VS Code extension support for it. The same workflow of Solidity and JavaScript would still work for these other blockchain platforms and approach.\nDocker # Docker is such a revolutionary technology in the past decade. It basically allows you to run an instance of an application with all of its runtime installing nothing else on your operating system. To be perfectly honest, the experience of Docker using a Windows host has given me a lot of headaches in the past. This is probably the reason whenever I work with Docker, especially the non-Microsoft stack (.NET / SQL Server) - I just do it on my Mac or Linux VM.\nDocker for Windows now supports WSL2 as the backend host! This is such a big deal, because the experience and general compatibility of a hosted container in Linux would just work now on your Windows machine. Another combo to the mix is how it works well with VS Code. As part of remote extensions, remote-containers allow you to interface with a container in a more intuitive way.\nSpecific to Blockchain, there are ways to set up your local blockchain development network using Docker. Things like Cardano, R3 Corda, and Hyperledger are the ones that come up to the list of hosting a blockchain that you can interface straight away. The same applies if you have to containerise your application or a hard fork of Ethereum. Doing it the Docker way is probably the best option\nWeb3 Wallet and Metamask # Under the hood, I believe WSL2 does port forwarding to Windows and would allow you to use any browser installed on Windows despite your contracts and apps are in WSL2. That means even if your frontend code is in WSL2 like React.js, you can see view it on Windows. Then from Windows, any wallet can work for you.\nMetamask - It\u0026rsquo;s been my go to wallet since 2017. I have seen no other competition that can really make me look at others. Only on an occasion that we have to support specific blockchain networks or smart contracts, that\u0026rsquo;s when I explore others. But for all things Ethereum, Metamask is king. Installing Metamask to Chrome, Edge, and Firefox is just as easy as installing any browser extensions.\nOther browser wallets include you might look at: Binance Chain, WalletConnect, Trust Wallet, MathWallet, TokenPocket, and the list goes on.\nOther Utilities # Zsh / oh my zsh - I\u0026rsquo;ve been a big fan of zsh and the whole plugin ecosystem around it. It\u0026rsquo;s the easiest way to have fancy terminals and comes with useful extensions like zsh-autosuggestions. This works in WSL2 despite your terminal (Windows Terminal or VS Code) are in Windows.\nHomebrew - Since I\u0026rsquo;ve spent a lot of time on MacOS because of involvement in mobile projects, brew is a familiar territory for me. This works just fine in WSL2 with no fuzz.\nGithub CLI - A recent addition to the CLIs that I loved especially on newly minted environment. Setting up auth with ssh, is just straightforward. Works with WSL2 as well!\nConclusion # Using Windows side by side with WSL2 would allow you to leverage the best of both worlds.\nDocker and Web browsers on Windows would interface just fine with WSL2.\nMost of the things you can do in Linux that are related to Blockchain development would work on WSL2.\nResources # Remote Development - Visual Studio Marketplace\nUsing Docker in Windows for Linux Subsystem (WSL) 2 (visualstudio.com)\nInstalling the Solidity Compiler — Solidity 0.8.8 documentation (soliditylang.org)\nSweet Tools for Smart Contracts | Truffle Suite\nHardhat | Ethereum development environment for professionals by Nomic Labs\nMetaMask\nTesting with Brownie — Vyper documentation\nnvm-sh/nvm: Node Version Manager - POSIX-compliant bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions (github.com)\nCardano | Home\nEnterprise Technology \u0026amp; Services Provider | R3\nHyperledger Fabric – Hyperledger\nOh My Zsh - a delightful \u0026amp; open source framework for Zsh\nGitHub CLI | Take GitHub to the command line\n","date":"15 August 2021","permalink":"/blog/blockchain-wsl2/","section":"Blogs","summary":"In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using my Macbook Pro to do all things blockchain and smart contracts development.","title":"Using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for Blockchain Development"},{"content":"Watching movies is my hobby.

It\u0026rsquo;s been quite some time now that it has involved me with blockchains and cryptos that over and over, I have to explain to people (often new clients) on what are these tokens. Even until now, at almost late 2021, I still get asked about these: Is it Bitcoin? Is it Ethereum? Is it Coin X, Coin Y? What are these NFTs? This is my attempt on how I can simplify these concepts to answer most of the important questions like what are these different tokens and shed some light on some real world use cases of them.\nThe term token is so generic that we have used it across different industries, practices, and domains. Like if you talk about tokens in web development \u0026amp; security, it\u0026rsquo;s most likely about the \u0026ldquo;Access Tokens\u0026rdquo;. But in the blockchain world, it\u0026rsquo;s somehow different. To avoid the confusion further, let\u0026rsquo;s narrow it down to 3 major types of tokens that are popular right now in circulation. They are the fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and hybrid tokens.\n   Some Basic Concepts of a Token # A token is a representation of X. And X could be anything. It is digital and may or may not represent an actual entity or atomic particle in the physical world. It can be a currency, an in-game item, a land title, an idea, a physical artwork, a virtual artwork, literally anything. The whole point of having a token is to represent something that is of value across different parties or the public community. Anything that has a value can be a token. Should they? That\u0026rsquo;s a question you should answer.\nA token is transferrable. We can transfer it from an Entity 1 to Entity 2. An entity could be anyone: a person, a business, a platform, anything that \u0026ldquo;owns\u0026rdquo;. We usually represent this ownership of tokens as an address (0X11\u0026hellip;.) in a wallet.\nA circulated token is owned. As mentioned above, at a specific point in time (or block in the chain) a token is owned or registered to a specific address.\nWe can create a token or, as we call them, \u0026ldquo;minted\u0026rdquo;. Depending on how the token was designed, it can be set to:\n  Mint once: (0 =\u0026gt; 10,000,000) and they will create no more tokens.\n  Mint anytime by Entity 1. Entity 1 can issue (0 =\u0026gt; 1) tokens or (0 =\u0026gt; 10,000 =\u0026gt; 100,000 =\u0026gt; infinity).\n  A token may be destroyed or others prefer the term \u0026ldquo;burn\u0026rdquo;.\nNot all tokens support burning. But if you really hate that token and want it to be gone, just transfer that to \u0026ldquo;Address 0\u0026rdquo;. Once it\u0026rsquo;s there, you can\u0026rsquo;t take it back.\nWe use token burning for a lot of reasons:\n  too much supply / less demand and wants to drive the value up.\n  natural life-cycle of token: { token created =\u0026gt; token transfer(s) =\u0026gt; token destroyed }\n  We can program Token behaviours and properties using \u0026ldquo;Smart Contracts\u0026rdquo;. These smart contracts are what the \u0026ldquo;Blockchain Developers\u0026rdquo; actually code. It about defining methods and events of a token depending on which \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; it currently sits.\nThere are different standards in place for tokens. The underlying blockchain network that you\u0026rsquo;re running your \u0026ldquo;Token Contracts\u0026rdquo; usually drives them.\nEIPs / ERCs: If you\u0026rsquo;re working on smart contracts and tokens, 90% of the time you will use Ethereum as a blockchain network. This could be the public ledger, for example, \u0026ldquo;MainNet\u0026rdquo; or privately hosted chains like \u0026ldquo;Quorum\u0026rdquo;, and any other implementations (aka Hard Fork). EIPs are proposals. ERCs are standards. These are specific to Ethereum (and hard forks) that standardises basic behaviours and properties of smart contracts.\nBEP, TRC, NEP, and the rest of non-Ethereum stack. Depending on which blockchain network you host your contract, they have a unique twist or improvements on how contracts can be standardised.\nToken Taxonomy Framework - This is an attempt to create a framework for tokens to establish a universal interoperability. This standard is not specific to any blockchain network or a law that companies need to follow.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the different tokens.\nFungible Tokens # Fungible tokens are of the same attributes (not unique) and are divisible. The most common use case is a currency. A person holding 100 Token X shares the same attribute of person B holding 100 Token X. There is a shared collective of what a quantity means, for example, what can you do about it: convert to FIAT (USD, AUD, PHP) or use it to get something else, for example, flight points, rewards, discounts, etc. Note that it\u0026rsquo;s not exclusive to coins or currencies other unit of measurements can be applied too, such as owning how many wine barrels, owning square meters of a land, a collateral token, and so much more.\nBitcoin, Ether, and all the Alt Coins # Bitcoin is fungible. It is a currency - a cryptocurrency. You can split and transfer it. It \u0026ldquo;represents\u0026rdquo; an intrinsic value that people all over the world share. Right now, there are just countless of applications that you can use Bitcoin: remittance, investments, international transfers, etc.\nEther is the oil \u0026amp; gas that power the Ethereum Main Network. It is a currency - a cryptocurrency in that regard because it\u0026rsquo;s a value that is exchanged across the network. It is divisible and can be owned. Ether is required to deploy and run smart contracts on the network. You can use ether to deploy your own tokens. You can use ether to buy NFTs.\nAlt Coins. Obviously because of the hype of cryptocurrencies in the past few years, there has been an emergence of other cryptocurrencies, aka \u0026ldquo;Alt Coins\u0026rdquo;. They either have their own blockchain network like Binance (BPB) and Cardano (ADA); or they simply piggy back on Ethereum through ERC-20 \u0026amp; ERC-777.\nERC-20 and ERC-777 # Ethereum, being around 90% market share of the alternative coins, now has these standards. ERC-20 comes with the base behaviours and properties like Minting, Transfer, Owning, etc. When you feel like creating your own coin, then you can consider ERC-20 or ERC-777 (an improved version) for your tokens in circulation.\n“Stable coins” # Although a topic of its own, stable coins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged toward the value of \u0026ldquo;stable\u0026rdquo; assets, such as FIAT currencies (USD, AUD, PHP). The popularity of stable coins came to be because of the high volatility of cryptocurrencies. They are fungible just like bitcoin and ether, but they are unique in a way that each unit is equal to what it corresponds to the stock market \u0026amp; traditional exchanges. Think of 1 stable coin equals 1 USD. We do not limit the use cases of these to FIAT currencies, but can also apply to assets like gold, oil, copper, etc. The popular stable coins out there are: Tether, DAI, Binance USD.\nOthers worth mentioning # Although Ethereum is the king of smart contracts and host for coins right now, there are other contenders around. Specially right now that Ethereum is experiencing some scaling issues, it\u0026rsquo;s worth having to look at what other blockchain networks and standards offer. But they are like ERC-20, where it\u0026rsquo;s about a cryptocurrency that is divisible, can be owned \u0026amp; transfer, and has value.\nBEP-2 and BEP-20 for Binance Smart Chain\nTRC-10 and TRC-20 for TRON\nCardano Native Tokens (note can also be an NFT / might better fall into hybrid)\nYour next \u0026ldquo;Alt Coin\u0026rdquo; # Inevitably, more and more coins or fungible tokens will emerge - and for good reasons. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you have any value within an organisation or business consortium that needs to be quantified and liquidated - then you need a fungible token. You need to put collateral when loaning something, then you need an FT again. You want to transfer your solar energy to your neighbour (without having the middlemen), then you need to have currency and exchange - FT again. So the list goes on, you\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised that not everything has been \u0026ldquo;tokenised\u0026rdquo; yet!\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) # To put it simply, every NFTs are unique. Any asset that you want to have a representation in digital can be an NFT. A player on a basketball team can be an NFT. An artwork or jewellery and the proof of ownership can be an NFT. Your land title can be an NFT. An engineer’s patent can be an NFT. Your parents’ certificate of completion, your grades, your diploma, your degree; your pen sitting on the desk inside the classroom on the school campus can be an NFT.\nAn NFT is exclusive to the owner until she/he transfers it to someone else. An exclusive in game item can be unique that only one exists throughout the ecosystem. Maybe owning a specific NFT allows you to unlock that same item across 5 different games. Think of your avatars or profile pictures as NFTs to show that you\u0026rsquo;re unique.\nERC-721 # ERC-721 is the bread and butter of most NFTs out there in the wild. It\u0026rsquo;s a standard that defines what an NFT is within the Ethereum ecosystem. It basically outlines how an asset can be distinguishable like no two houses are alike, the same goes with cats. Majority that you see in the marketplaces like OpenSea are of ERC-721. ERC-721 can represent digital (virtual) or physical assets.\nYour next asset tokens # Whether you choose to use ERC 721 or extend it, your next asset would probably be in a form of NFT. When people or clients ask me if there are more NFT ideas that can be done? I say, yes! There is still a lot of provenance problem happening around. Just think of a future where access to subscriptions is NFTs. All the things that you wear and own are NFTs; and the concept is not obscure - people don\u0026rsquo;t have to ask if you really own it. There are mechanisms to know it. We can think of the future where even the very bottled drink that you ordered through a vending machine will be traced once there\u0026rsquo;s a massive poisoning. The ideas are endless! We need more NFTs.\nHybrid Tokens # Although ERC-721 allows you to create individual unique tokens, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s too limited to specific use cases. Most of the problems that I experienced with NFTs are scaling them when we are talking about provenance and large volume of quantities (thousands or millions per batch). The network, even if it is self hosted, at least for now, will not cut having to mint millions of unique NFTs to represent every item in a batch.\nERC 1155 # This is a multi-standard token that allows you to mix both fungible and non-fungible properties. Think of it like having unique tokens but can be divided. Some of the good use cases I had the experience of doing this are through the protein and meat industry. Instead of having individual NFTs per cow, you can batch them through an ERC-1155 with specific Token Ids per animal. The same can apply to anything within the supply chain that can be batched. I also worked on book copies being ERC-1155 where a book can have a few supplies in the circulation.\nYour Next Complex token # Depending on what business domains that you work on, sometimes Fungible and Non-Fungible tokens are quite limiting. For now, they are called hybrid tokens. But eventually this will emerge as specific standards or nickname across various industries. Maybe a blood count in the medicine may not fall under FT and NFTs. Electricity, water, and gas supplies are not simply fungible. There could be a different standard should be made for interlocking tokens, for example, building blocks of NFTs and FTs to create a new token.\nThis goes back again to what I keep telling my clients that, there are a lot more business opportunities in this place. I, for one, am investing some time, effort, and money to explore other hybrid tokens. Think of any system where trust can be given and automated (ethics not in violation) so that transactions and flow are more seamless. There are a lot of \u0026ldquo;data swamps\u0026rdquo; or batches of Excel files floating all over the world waiting to be reconciled. They can be programmed to be automated, they can be written in smart contracts, they can be represented as tokens.\nWhere is this whole token mania heading? # One thing I can say is that there is no stopping on the growth of tokens whether new tokens will arrive or more people will take part in existing tokens across various networks and platforms. Enterprises already adopt these technologies. Some are simple, some are more complex. Most of them are just extensions of their existing products and some are totally re-imagined greenfield ideas.\nThe real value of tokens, in my opinion, is when you don\u0026rsquo;t actually have to think the underlying technology around it whether what data is in blockchain. It\u0026rsquo;s more around enabling inclusive, secured, and private transactions. It when participation across multiple parties is more efficient and optimizes for joint growth: no more haggling who owns and responsible to what at a specific point.\nIf you need help on finding or \u0026ldquo;minting\u0026rdquo; your next token idea, just email me at: michael@datachain.consulting\n","date":"10 August 2021","permalink":"/blog/blockchain-tokens/","section":"Blogs","summary":"So you keep hearing or reading about \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo;, these \u0026ldquo;cryptos\u0026rdquo;, the \u0026ldquo;blockchain bitcoins\u0026rdquo;, and so on.","title":"What are these blockchain and crypto tokens?"},{"content":"Sydney is home for me.

Gone are the days when .NET only works on Windows. However, as the journey to \u0026ldquo;One .NET\u0026rdquo; is still unfolding, there is a lot of confusion on how we can use .NET on MacOS. There is Mono, .NET Core, .NET 5, Xamarin.Mac, Xamarin.Forms, Mac Catalyst, .NET 6, and MAUI. This blog post explains some of the core concepts across these nomenclature.\nMono and .NET #   Mono is the original vision and execution of having .NET and C# available to non-Windows platform. The project has been around since 2004 and was as an alternative way of using .NET on MacOS. It\u0026rsquo;s not officially supported by Microsoft (specially back then) and it\u0026rsquo;s a project started by the legendary Miguel de Icaza who also started GNOME and eventually Xamarin.\n  Mono can run not just on MacOS and Linux, but also on gaming and mobile operating systems like iOS, Android, and PlayStation. It\u0026rsquo;s the roots of what\u0026rsquo;s now called Xamarin.\n  Xamarin #   Xamarin was the commercial spin-off of Mono for Mac, iOS, and Android. It was later acquired by Microsoft and became part of the wider Developer tools ecosystem such as Visual Studio and .NET. To understand how it relates specifically to Mac OS, we have to talk about Xamarin.Mac and Xamarin.Forms.\n  Xamarin.Mac #   It started as MonoMac and eventually carried out as Xamarin.Mac. These libraries create bindings between the native Mac OS APIs and exposed as C#. This allows you to create a Mac OS application written in C# instead of Objective-C/Swift.\n  Under the hood, it still uses XCode and follows the same principles like: AppDelegatre, Main, Entitlements, Plists, provisioning profiles, etc. Xamarin.Mac allows you to transpile the C# code into something that XCode will eventually compile to create the \u0026ldquo;.app\u0026rdquo; package.\n  In Xamarin.Mac (using Visual Studio for Mac) you can define your user interfaces using Storyboards and will invoke XCode for you to do the UI components and data bindings.\n    Xamarin.Forms #   Xamarin.Forms is a cross-platform UI framework that allows you to create native applications on MacOS, iOS, Android, Windows, and even Tizen OS. Unlike Xamarin.Mac, using Xamarin.Forms, you can use XAML and C# to create your components.\n  The advantage of this approach is the flexibility of targeting multiple platforms using the same code base. The result, however, is still native. Even if you coded your button in C# / XAML, the result is still a native MacOS button.\n  Under the hood, you would still have a Xamarin.Mac project that just calls the Xamarin.Forms project. It just abstracts the creation of the app in Xamarin.Forms layer.\n  You have the flexibility on your Xamarin.Forms project to only render components depending on the target platform: ie show this button on MacOS but not on Windows. You also have the flexibility of having a single function on Xamarin.Forms that implements differently on each platform: ie press this button and it will do X for MacOS and it will do Y for Windows.\n    .NET 5 (Core) #   .NET 5 is now a general purpose framework to build apps targeting Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Unlike the traditional \u0026ldquo;.NET framework\u0026rdquo; which is exclusive to Windows, .NET 5 (previous iteration called .NET Core) is a step to create apps that can use MacOS as the host. Think of it you can now treat MacOS as the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; host of your .NET app.\n  What this means is that .NET 5 now supports the whole ASPNET family (Blazor, API, gRPC, React, Angular, Vue) on Mac. It also now supports console apps and worker services you would traditionally can do on a Windows machine. The power of this lies with having portable libraries such as ML.NET work on Mac as well.\n  However, .NET 5 doesn\u0026rsquo;t interface yet with Cocoa or the rich native libraries of MacOS like Xamarin.Mac does. More of that on .NET 6 onwards.\n  Mac Catalyst #   Mac Catalyst is totally independent of .NET 6 or even Xamarin. It is basically Apple\u0026rsquo;s approach of having shared libraries between Mac OS and the new iPad OS. This allows you to have unified and consistent components like pop-up buttons, tooltips, window\u0026rsquo;s sidebar. This also allows you to share code for implementing GameKit, PassKit, Core Audio, Core Bluetooth amongst others.\n  Unlike when the previous versions of iPad uses iOS, it\u0026rsquo;s more of a mobile device using mobile libraries and frameworks and less of what you can do on Mac OS. This time around, it\u0026rsquo;s now becoming a more unified experience between a tablet and laptop in the Apple ecosystem.\n  In order to run Mac Catalyst, you need XCode 13 on either Big Sur or Monterey.\n  .NET 6 and MAUI #   There are a lot of updates for .NET 6, and it\u0026rsquo;s very exciting because this is really a borderless unified framework.\n  .NET 6 introduced the concept of \u0026ldquo;workload\u0026rdquo; that allows you to install SDKs on top of the .NET 6 SDK to target specific platforms. What this means on Mac OS apps is that you can use .NET 6 as your base project and you\u0026rsquo;re confident that it can execute those line of codes across all platforms. The \u0026ldquo;workload\u0026rdquo; is the platform specific SDKs and bindings to target that specific platform and leverage the native capabilities. Think of all the libraries that existed in the past and can now expand its reach to more platforms!\n  .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is the evolution of Xamarin.Forms in combination of UWP. Imagine having a single unified UI approach in building apps that works across platform. Think of it in the future, you can port your legacy WinForms / WPF app to run on iPad OS with MAUI and MacCatalyst!\n  These are the workloads that apply to MacOS\n dotnet workload install microsoft-macos-sdk-full dotnet workload install microsoft-maccatalyst-sdk-full dotnet workload install maui-maccatalyst        If you\u0026rsquo;re already familiar with Xamarin ecosystem, pretty much this is the simplified version:  Xamarin.Mac =\u0026gt; Microsoft-MacOS Xamarin.MaciOS + Mac Catalyst =\u0026gt; Microsoft-MacCatalyst Xamarin.Forms + UWP =\u0026gt; MAUI    Summary #  Mono is arguably the roots and inspiration on having .NET to run across all platforms (besides Windows). Xamarin made its way to having .NET runs commercially on MacOS and mobile platforms. .NET 5 is relevant right now to MacOS to host server-side applications, not client apps you install on your \u0026ldquo;Applications\u0026rdquo; folder. .NET 6 onwards creates an interesting take of having .NET to run everywhere! There are a lot of opportunities to share code between Web, Mobile, and IoT projects. MAUI is a road forward in creating rich and native user experience that can work to all platforms.

Compared to my usual technical talks, this time it\u0026rsquo;s about inspiring the younger generation and to share some of the key lessons and experiences I\u0026rsquo;ve had for over 12 years since I graduated. This is also a good reflection of what I will advise my younger self if I am talking to him right now.\nBelow, I summarize my speech that is in a written medium. The words may not be the same, but the meaning are.\n   What is success? # What is success? Spoiler alert: It\u0026rsquo;s relative. What it means is that success would mean differently to every individual. Other would consider having a lot of money as successful. For some, it\u0026rsquo;s about having influence and fanbase. Others are about being a CEO or director of a company.\nAchieving \u0026ldquo;success\u0026rdquo; is actually very simple, but the process is often hard. For example, if you want to be an author, all you have to do is to keep on writing - over and over, day in and out. You won\u0026rsquo;t be an author \u0026ldquo;overnight\u0026rdquo; per se, it\u0026rsquo;s those thousands and millions of words that come out of your mind and the hundreds of revisions that will make you an author.\nThe same applies to being an entrepreneur. All you have to do is to keep on exploring business opportunities. Keep on selling solutions to people\u0026rsquo;s problem. It\u0026rsquo;s about the constant market research, the cold-calling, networking events, and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s those hundreds of rejections when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to convince investors to put money to your startup product. Learn, iterate, pivot - repeat.\nAnother example is doing marathons. To be good at running, cycling, swimming, and other cardio activities - you just have to keep training repeatedly. Again, simple but hard. I could cycle 100 KM in less than 6 hours. The achievement is not a world record or so, but I am thrilled with the results. It\u0026rsquo;s because it was me trying to set a goal and during those hours of the journey, I almost always wanted to give up. It was a mental game that I had to endure. With all these unique challenges that I face and overcome, I achieve more success in life. The internal success if much more important than what the rest of the world has to say.\nThe world is full of influencers. Dangerous influencers. Most of the time, they are after their own agenda. You\u0026rsquo;re just a number in their likes, views, and subscribers. They don\u0026rsquo;t just sell you products that you may not need, but they also sell you dangerous ideas. Some of them sell the idea that material possession equates to success: mansions, sports car, and vices will bring you ABSOLUTE happiness. Of course, a lot of these material aspirations are not necessarily bad like owning a house or luxury cars, but if it is the one and only measure of your success, then you have to think harder.\nNext time, criticize. Ponder if it\u0026rsquo;s legit. Does it apply to me? Add a comment to that post, share your insights, write about what you think, constantly redefine what is \u0026ldquo;success.\u0026rdquo; Do you agree with what I am saying right now?\nPassion, Profession, and Passion # Now, I want to tackle about finding a career for you. Spoiler alert again: There is no single answer. There are so many factors in play to find a fulfilling career, but let me explain some of the core parameters that you can look at.\nDuring the last 2 to 3 years, what are the projects that you\u0026rsquo;re in \u0026ldquo;FLOW\u0026rdquo; or as we call it, \u0026ldquo;In the zone\u0026rdquo;. Those times when you didn\u0026rsquo;t really count the number of hours while working on that project. That is what you call PASSION. It\u0026rsquo;s about doing the \u0026ldquo;extra mile\u0026rdquo; not because someone else said it, it\u0026rsquo;s because you have the burning fuel inside you to do it. For me, it was solving complex problems with code and technology. For others it may be video editing, writing, studying a complex mathematical topics, history, drawing, and so on. Some of them are very specific like \u0026ldquo;DNA sequencing\u0026rdquo; in biology class or it could be a mix of different topics.\nBut could that be a profession? Some of them yes, and some are unfortunately almost always a hard \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;. In order for a passion to be a profession, it needs to be valued by others. Someone has to pay you for that skill, knowledge, or experience. That\u0026rsquo;s where it\u0026rsquo;s important to see what the market needs rather than what you want. Some are lucky like me I am passionate about something that is in demand right now. For some, they have to do the hard work to market that skill or find a fitting profession for it.\nBut sometimes, there is \u0026ldquo;no calling\u0026rdquo;. Unlike in those movies when it\u0026rsquo;s the lightbulb scene and the protagonist figures it out; sometimes that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen in the real world. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you\u0026rsquo;re hopeless or with \u0026ldquo;no future.\u0026rdquo; You just need to figure out your purpose along the way. It might take you years or decades to find your real purposeful profession.\nWhatever happens, don\u0026rsquo;t be in the \u0026ldquo;auto-pilot\u0026rdquo; mode. Don\u0026rsquo;t make a career choice \u0026ldquo;just because\u0026rdquo; or because you have a fear of missing out. I know it\u0026rsquo;s hard, but try to believe in to something, whatever \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rdquo; is. Believe that you\u0026rsquo;ll do great things in this world. Believe that you\u0026rsquo;ll be a successful entrepreneur, a world-class architect, a best-selling author, a loving family member of the community. Because you\u0026rsquo;ll be needing that belief to fuel your every day with motivation.\nForever learning # Now that you know what success could be and what purposeful profession you want to do, it\u0026rsquo;s time to remember that the road is not a simple 10 meter straight line. The only proven way to guarantee outcome is to learn all the time from your experiences.\nSometimes the easiest way to learn about something is to simply just do it. You will eventually hear the concept of \u0026ldquo;10,000\u0026rdquo; hours. Spend the time to master and craft that skill, you will learn what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Some are talented and passionate that they don\u0026rsquo;t need the 10,000 hours - but the world is moving fast these past few years. A lot of the things that we value now didn\u0026rsquo;t exist decades ago. If you want to change the world, then do that first little step, that first little punch, that first word on your pen.\nIn order to fast track your career, find mentors. Get frequent feedback about the work that you do and how you can improve in the future. Be open to criticism but don\u0026rsquo;t take 100% of it, just take them as feedback that you may or may not do. Remember, you\u0026rsquo;re in the driver\u0026rsquo;s seat and sometimes you just need guidance.\nLearn by teaching. One of the easiest way to know if you really have mastery of the topic is, if you can simplify complex topics and share it with others. Contribute your knowledge and wisdom to others. Present at conferences, mentor people who need guidance, create a blog or website. Be a creator, not just a consumer.\nSummary - Give yourself the permission to fail # In summary, success is relative and not definitive. Find a purpose to your profession. Don\u0026rsquo;t stop learning.\nI would like to end this by saying that the world is unfair, it rarely revolves around \u0026ldquo;just for you.\u0026rdquo; Not everyone has equal opportunities and resources. That you\u0026rsquo;re here reading this blog post from that screen, you\u0026rsquo;re already more fortunate than others.\nAs one of my favourite authors \u0026ldquo;Nassim Taleb\u0026rdquo;, wrote in the book \u0026ldquo;Antifragile\u0026rdquo;. Embrace the chaos and actually benefit from it.\nGive yourself the permission to fail. But don’t just fail repeatedly. Learn from each one of them, and emerge as a new and more successful person.\n","date":"21 July 2021","permalink":"/blog/message-to-the-young/","section":"Blogs","summary":"I recently gave a graduation speech to my high school alma matter.","title":"Message to the young"},{"content":"Sometimes I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that there is such thing as a \u0026ldquo;deadline\u0026rdquo; or end of life for a project.

Actually, quite the contrary is happening in the past year. There are more and more interest and it\u0026rsquo;s gaining a lot more traction than before. A big portion of this growth is due to \u0026ldquo;DeFi\u0026rdquo; AKA Decentralised Finance applications. From the hyped cryptocurrencies, we are now seeing the new next wave of this transformation as we see more financial products being developed: lending, exchanges, yield farming, and pools just to name a few. It is a hot topic right now and there are a lot of demand in this space. There are also a lot of opportunities to start creating your own innovative products as part of this wave.\n   Warning: Cryptocurrencies involve risks, so do your own research before investing.\nWhy DeFi and blockchain? # There are a lot of locked money right now in DeFi. As of now, we have at least 54 Billion dollar worth of locked assets that are circulating just in this vertical.\n   Image taken from: https://defipulse.com @ 13/July/2021\nDeveloper / Technology #  A lot of demand to DApps developers. A lot of saturation in open source community. The tools and technologies are improving in a rapid pace.  Startup Founder #  An opportunity to start a new product or service offering. Opportunities to raise capital or funding. The market is still maturing and open to innovation.  Works in Finance #  DeFi \u0026ldquo;has been\u0026rdquo; disrupting traditional financial products Opportunity to adapt and innovate. Leverage DeFi side-by-side with your existing products.  What is DeFi or Decentralized Finance? #    Image taken from: Stably blog on Medium\nDeFi is similar to how we call Financial Technologies as \u0026ldquo;FinTech\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s an industry vertical use of decentralised technologies that are specific to financial products. This includes exchanges, lending \u0026amp; borrowing, interests \u0026amp; compounds, staking \u0026amp; liquidity pools, and many more.\nOne of the key advantages of DeFi is the decentralised nature of it. Compared to traditional banking and financial institutes, you need a \u0026ldquo;middle man\u0026rdquo; in order to do transactions. With the use of decentralised technologies, no central entity have \u0026ldquo;control\u0026rdquo; on the network of exchanges and transactions. This allows more efficient and straightforward transactions across individuals.\nWhat makes a product DeFi? # Throughout the years, there has been so many use cases of blockchain and decentralised technologies. There are also a lot of applications that seems to be just partially decentralised. These are some of the properties to look at in order for a product to utilise these revolutionary movement.\nTransparency #    SushiSwap contract on Ethereum\nTransparency is one of the most important reason on why you would even want to use blockchaind and decentralised technologies. With these technologies, you can have an end to end trace of all the transactions that are happeing within the chain and the DeFi apps. A lot of DeFi apps are also open-sourced in order to gain reputation and peer review from the wider community.\nAccessibility #    Image taken from Forbes: How DeFi is Reinventing The World\u0026rsquo;s Financial System\nUnlike traditional banking products, you need to be in a certain category or must have specific things in order to do transactions. A DeFi should be inclusive to all users all over the world regardless of your ethnicity, race, religion, gender, and to an extent your financial background.\nAccountability #    Althoguht it is totally optional, as the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto still remains anonymous; the world is changing. It is intrinsic in our nature to trust people, brand, and entities. As there has been a lot of scams and risks in this industry, having to know the founders and their background would gain confidence for people to use your DeFi product.\nInteroperability #    Image taken from Binance Academy Article\nThis is a hard technical problem to have. Interoperability means your asset or product can work to various blockchain networks, or supports multiple types of coin, and even support non-blockchain data. I\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with these and I\u0026rsquo;m telling you it\u0026rsquo;s not one of the easiest thing to work on. There are a lot of performance considerations as well as overall user experiences.\nUse Cases and Popular DeFi Apps # There are a lot of popular use cases and DeFi Apps lately. Although some are more dominant than others in terms of locked asset, there are still a lot of opportunities to capture more market. Here are some of the popular DApps (Decentralised Apps) out there that are categorised as DeFi.\nExchanges # UniSwap is a fully decentralized on-chain protocol for token exchange on Ethereum that uses liquidity pools instead of order books.   https://uniswap.exchange\nSushiSwap is a fully decentralized on-chain protocol for exchanging tokens through a process of automated market-making (AMM) which uses \u0026rsquo;liquidity pools\u0026rsquo; rather than an orderbook.   https://app.sushi.com\nPancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange built on Binance Smart Chain.   https://pancakeswap.finance\nLending # Compound is an algorithmic money market protocol on Ethereum that lets users earn interest or borrow assets against collateral. Compound Labs %28@compoundfinance%29 | Twitter https://app.compound.finance/\nAave (from the Finnish word for \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo;) is an open source non-custodial protocol on Ethereum for decentralized lending and borrowing   https://app.aave.com/\nMakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports Dai, a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD.   https://oasis.app\nAssets / Yields # Synthetix is a decentralized platform on Ethereum for the creation of Synths: on-chain synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets.   https://staking.synthetix.io\nYearn.finance is a decentralized ecosystem of aggregators that utilize lending services such as Aave, Compound, Dydx, and Fulcrum to optimize your token lending.   https://yearn.finance\nHow to Get Started? # If you want to get started creating a DeFi product (before jumping to code or hard technical bits), these are some of the guiding pillars that you can look at in order to structure your thought processing.\nDefine your \u0026ldquo;Asset\u0026rdquo; # You first have to define what is the \u0026ldquo;asset\u0026rdquo; of your product. Are you thinking of creating an exchange, a marketplace, lending platform, etc.\nThese are some of the common standards to look at to get started:\n  Your own fungible token ie create your own Currency (ERC-20) / (BEP-20)\n https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/ https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP20.md    NFTs / Non-fungible tokens meaning assets that are unique such as trading cards, game items, etc (ERC-721) / (EIP-1155)\n https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/ https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155    Chain/Network # The next part is choosing which chain do you want to use.\nThe popular ones are:\n Ethereum Binance Smart Chain TRON Stellar  and you\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised that there are more. A lot more.\nAnother option is to hard fork one of these or spin-up your own infrastructure.\nWallets # Wallets are what holds those different assets, whether they cryptocurrencies or NFTs. There are so many to choose from these days: from browser extensions, mobile apps, hardware ledger, the list goes on.\nThey vary in security layers and user experience.\nYou need to work on which of these wallets will support your product.\nThe popular ones are Metamask for Web and Argent for Mobile.\nStablecoins # Given the volatility of the crypto market, you have options to use stablecoins. Stablecoins are basically instruments that allow you to put your assets or coins as collateral against the value of a stable product such as USD, Oil, Gold, etc. These are very useful in products that leverage collaterals.\nHowever, there are some opinions around it wherein if you are still married with these traditional assets, then you might not be really fully embracing the cryptocurrency world.\nOther DeFi products # Sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t really have to do everything from scratch. You can mix and match different products and platforms as they are not your core business or focus. Most of the DeFi products embraces the use of APIs and SDKs as a means of interoperability.\nChallenges of DeFi # Although DeFi and the whole world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies have a lot of potential to improve, this is still a relative young market. There are still a lot of lessons learnt to have, as well as more innovative products to come.\nThere are still a lot of unregulated products and platforms around. This is actually very complex as decentralization now opens a larger border than just governing countries. We need more political leaders to regulate this as a means of proper and innovative financial instrument that people all over the world can really benefit from.\nAnother current problem that most DeFi faces is problem with scalability as the Ethereum network is having a hard time to cater a lot of transactions. Not only that, but as well as some current limitations of smart contracts in terms of size and gas costs. I am confident though that this is a problem that the market will eventually evolve to overcome.\nSummary and Resources #  DeFi gives a new wave of more materialised crypto. The market is still maturing and has a lot of room to grow. Ethereum is the most popular chain to build DeFi.

The main reason for this is context switching, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t get distracted and I have a \u0026ldquo;physical switch\u0026rdquo; to tell myself \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time to do\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; I also intentionally placed the KVM switch near my foot, so I have to force myself to dock to press that button.\nThis blog post is about how I use MacOS and Windows to various workflow that I do as a business owner and software engineer.\nHardware #  Desktop (i9, 128GB RAM, RTX 3080 ti, 2TB SSD) that runs Windows 10 Macbook Pro 16″ (i9, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for main use M1 Macbook Air for portable use KVM Switch: Display and Accessories 3 Monitors with different lengths with VESA support  2 of which are attached to KVM Switch, and the other one I have to unplug/plug to Windows Desktop/Mac   Logitech MX Master 3 plugged to KVM switch Logitech Steelseeries mechanical keyboard plugged to KVM switch. Blue Yeti Snowball microphone attached to KVM switch Bose QC35 for headset paired to both MacOS and Windows Desktop 1080p Logitech web cam attached to Windows Desktop only Generic sound bar speaker attached to Windows Desktop only Generic lighting equipment Dongles (USB-C to HDMI/USB-A) mainly for Mac Mobile Phones (iPhones and Android phones) for testing purposes A pen and a hard bound notebook if I need to draw something  Windows workflow # General Business and Office # When writing proposals and other business related documents, I still prefer to use Microsoft Word for Windows as it is complete with all the features that I need.\nExcel for Windows in my experience has been more stable than the MacOS equivalent. Running complex formula and loading a lot of data, is a much smoother experience for me. I don\u0026rsquo;t even bother with non-Excel app at all.\nAlthough I can open all websites to any device with a browser (and sync bookmarks), I prefer to use this machine for all business related sites:\n Banking websites Accounting websites (Quickbooks/Xero) Document signing and business registrations Outsourcing (Fiverr, Upwork, etc)  Primary Presenter # NVIDIA Broadcast is a game changer for me. I live in a place where constant noise is passing by, so Broadcast\u0026rsquo;s capability to do noise cancellation (for free) is really good.\nPowerpoint for Windows has been my default tool of choice for slides, as it is complete with all the features that I need. The MacOS equivalent, Keynote, and Google Slides lack some of the advanced features that I need.\nAll my collaboration and messaging apps also lives in Windows (with backup on MacOS):\n Microsoft Teams Zoom Cisco WebEx Slack Discord Facebook Messenger (App) Signal \u0026amp; WhatsApp  General Research # Although I obviously have browsers across all devices, I use the Windows machine as my go to research device. This means I use this for googling things and scroll to various materials such as books, articles, research papers.\nI use [[RoamResearch]] as my single dump of all my notes and general writing. It\u0026rsquo;s my \u0026ldquo;second brain.\u0026rdquo; This is my choice of tool that works across all platforms. I make sure all notes are dumped here.\nI also use Instapaper to convert web links that I want to read later on.\n.NET and Windows Desktop Development # The full Visual Studio (2019) for Windows is very helpful when working on big .NET projects. It comes with a lot of GUI tools that I am already familiar since the beginning of my .NET journey in 2009.\nI also have a project right now that deals with Win32 and a lot of native Windows modules such as NativeWifi and Active Directory. This is a hard dependency of using a Windows machine for this specific projects.\nA couple of years back when I was playing out Hololens, Mixed Reality, and Unity; I was only able to do it in Windows.\nAzure Development and Infrastructure # I installed Azure CLI on Windows mainly because of Powershell. I have a lot of ARM templates and automation scripts that are in Powershell and it\u0026rsquo;s just a good context to mix this with Azure CLI on Windows.\nIt also happened to be that a lot of my Azure related projects are within the Microsoft ecosystem: SQL Server (SSMS), ASP.NET, and Windows IoT - again something I prefer to do in the Windows ecosystem because of familiarity.\nBlockchain Development # I use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for these purposes. I install all the dependencies around it. The commons are: NodeJS (NVM), Go, Rust, Python, and a bunch of CLI tools.\nI use Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE in writing smart contracts. The fun part of using VSCode is that, I can always target WSL2 for debugging and deploying purposes.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very new to Go and Rust as a trendy programming languages. Learning them through WSL2 is a very cool sandboxed environment for me to play around.\nMachine Learning Development # I worked on a ML.NET project, and using a Windows machine works perfectly. Although it\u0026rsquo;s not really dependent on the OS, I just really find the fun of working with .NET on Windows in general - again familiarity.\nI used to bother installing Anaconda, Keras, TensorFlow, and all other Python dependencies on Windows (and tried on WSL), but I didn\u0026rsquo;t find the experience pleasant. These days, I just use a managed server / cluster on cloud ie Jupyter kernel, Databricks, Azure ML, and Azure Synapse.\nMacOS workflow # Mobile Development # When you\u0026rsquo;re developing an iPhone app, it\u0026rsquo;s always a need to have a MacOS machine. Specially when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with application signing, bundling, certificates - they all live in the close walled gardens of Apple.\nAlthough I can use Windows for Android development, I just prefer to use a Mac so that I have a single device to work on \u0026ldquo;just mobile\u0026rdquo;. This goes with the rest of the Android suite: ADB, JDKs, SDKs, Gradle, Scala, Groovy, and Maven.\nI also work on Cross-Platform technologies like Xamarin, React Native, Flutter, Swift UI, and based from experience, it\u0026rsquo;s a much smoother experience to have this workflow on a MacOS. Otherwise, you will be working on Android only, then think about iOS as an after thought.\nMacOS Desktop Development # I am also working on a MacOS Desktop project, and with no surprise you will be needing a Mac hardware for this.\nOn a separate note, I don\u0026rsquo;t find AppleScript as a fun experience. But Swift is a really good programming language to work on. :)\nWeb Front-end (JavaScript/TypeScript) Development # These days I usually work on a React frontend. I did touch on some Angular and Vue, but my involvement is very minimal. It\u0026rsquo;s all the familiar toolset of NodeJS, TypeScript, and npm tools and packages.\nI prefer to work on MacOS for Web Front-end development because of Safari! Although the whole world is really about Chrome, most web projects require for it to work on Safari.\nAlso given that when I work on React Native, I do it on a Mac. The context switching of sharing those React components across mobile and web, it\u0026rsquo;s just easier to test on a single machine.\nJava everywhere # Java is a programming language and platform that I didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly prefer, but an inevitable thing that you see time and time again in your career. Given that my Android development workflow is in MacOS, all things Java related, I just do them on MacOS too.\nConclusion # I prefer to use Windows for the \u0026ldquo;Office work\u0026rdquo;, .NET \u0026amp; Azure Development, and my primary presenting device. WSL also brings a lot of flexibility to have Linux without the need of VMs or Dual Boot.\nI prefer to use MacOS for all things mobile and web front-end. Although a lot of these workflows can be done on Windows, the energy of iOS/MacOS/Swift just drags me back to sticking with MacOS.\nIn an alternative universe, if XCode Tools and general iOS development becomes available as a Docker Container or WSM (Windows Subsystem for MacOS), then Windows will be my one and only device.\n","date":"13 July 2021","permalink":"/blog/my-ultimate-windows-and-mac-setup/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Introduction #    My Battle Station @ 2021","title":"My Ultimate Windows and Mac Setup (2021 Edition)"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s okay to be bored from time to time.

There are a lot of reasons why you would like to SSH to a Linux server such as checking configuration files, copying files, or even port forwarding.\nJust open your MacOS terminal and the command to ssh to a Linux Server is as simple as:\nssh user@host or ssh michael@192.0.0.1\nHowever, where it gets tricky is when you need to use a proxy such as SOCKS5 in order to access that Linux server from your MacOS machine.\nInstallation # I ended up using ssh-connect which can easily be installed using Homebrew.\nbrew install connect\nUseful Commands # Set SOCKS5 Password # Now in order to use a proxy such as SOCKS5, it\u0026rsquo;s best to export the password prior to the SSH command, otherwise you will end up typing this password repeatedly.\nexport SOCKS5_PASSWORD='XXXXXXXXXXXXX\nSSH session # Now to start an SSH session to that Linux server, use the following command:\nssh -o 'ProxyCommand=/usr/local/bin/connect -S michael-px@sshproxydomain​:1080 %h %p' michael-vm@192.0.0.1\nmichael-px is my user under the SOCKS5 proxy.

I\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of conversations and people I\u0026rsquo;ve met online and in-person to talk about it. Over and over, I see patterns on the people I interact with whether they do it as part of their job, an enthusiast, developer, investor, or simply just a person.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve probably had hundreds of interactions already and most likely, they will belong to either of these 3 buckets. I know generalisation is bad because not all people are the same, but it helps my brain to become more structured on what approach and ideas that I use during these conversations.\n   Hyped with cryptocurrency # It\u0026rsquo;s no denying that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum made Blockchain more popular as it brought hype around it from 2016 onwards. There is a monetary aspect of it. Stories of those who got rich because of cryptocurrencies spread like wildfire. The fear of missing out was everywhere, and everyone wants to have a piece of that pie. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s natural for people, in particular not in the technology domain to be curious around it as having money and wealth is a \u0026ldquo;pragmatic\u0026rdquo; aspiration for everyone.\nThese are the people who frequently ask me what coin to invest, where is the money going to, how can you 10x your liquidity and valuation. Some conversations are fun like challenging values of a cryptocurrencies, what factors drive the volatility, and what can actually drive the value of that coin. However, when the conversation is purely on \u0026ldquo;becoming rich quick\u0026rdquo;, it always gets in to my nerve to avoid this conversation. Talks around putting in life savings, retirement funds, and what not, it\u0026rsquo;s just a very destructive conversation. For one, I am not a financial advisor, but, if you oversimplify things, it\u0026rsquo;s nowhere different to stock market, only it\u0026rsquo;s 24/7, and it\u0026rsquo;s much more volatile.\nDuring 2016 and 2017, I also spend a part of my day-to-day time observing and researching the market, however I don\u0026rsquo;t see it precious for me anymore. The market is so volatile and the amount of mental real-estate that you have to invest in order to have gains, at least for me, is not worth it. I did some simple math back then that if I spend 4 hours a day of observation and research to have 1% chance to make $100 to $1000 but 80% chance that my $1000 can become $100 overnight then I\u0026rsquo;d rather find the avenue to earn those gains somewhere. Of course, a lot of factors will be at play like luck (survivorship bias and fooled by randomness), pure understanding of the coin value, time in the market (hold vs sell); but the space it occupies on my head still does not justify the gains.\nNowadays, this hype still occurs and having a second wave of hype because of DeFi (Decentralised Finance). It\u0026rsquo;s a very novel and interesting concept as this is a second attempt to make these coins as a proper liquidity asset. I\u0026rsquo;m actually writing a book about it. So watch out for this space. 🙂\nThe Technologist # I belong to this group and this is the angle I\u0026rsquo;m always gearing towards to when talking about Blockchain. As someone who is in the technology space, it was fascinating back in 2014 for me to see how this type of infrastructure and architecture can be at play. Prior to knowing Blockchain, I am very intrigued on \u0026ldquo;Distributed Systems\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Database Sharding\u0026rdquo; as they are simple concepts but very hard to implement!\nThese are the people I met where they challenge me on \u0026ldquo;Why not just use a Database?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Why is it slow and expensive?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Do you really need Blockchain?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;onchain\u0026rsquo; and what\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;offchain\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; Jargon after jargon, technology after technology, more questions than answers. Of course, the answer will always be \u0026ldquo;it depends\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s on a case to case basis. As someone who is maturing in Information Technology, it\u0026rsquo;s a natural cycle to be skeptical of a technology (or process) rather than just accepting them and hype around it. I enjoy having these conversations, as I also learn a lot from these people beyond Blockchain concepts - their brains are working as engineers, scientists, and technology entrepreneurs.\nNowadays, I\u0026rsquo;m having less of these conversations. This is because of a lot of factors: programming on it is not very fun or relatable (a lot of unlearning), they understood it and wants to move on, they are not impressed on the technology, a lot of the good use-cases have already been researched and piloted, and \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s always a new hype.\u0026rdquo; There are still those dazzling set of individuals who are actively pushing the boundaries of this space, and the technology and industry around it is nowhere closer to dead.\nThe Philosopher # Ah! These peeps. Since philosophy and social structures are subjective to a lot of interpersonal relationships, for me it\u0026rsquo;s always a hit or miss when \u0026ldquo;this philosopher\u0026rdquo; talks about Blockchain. In a nutshell, these peeps believe Blockchain will change the way we live our world right now. They talk about disrupting the finance industries like living in a future with no banks, taking about not needing to have government and we can just rely on AI + Blockchain for judiciary systems, and a lot more extreme examples.\nThere are those who are less extreme like talking about process improvements such as removing the erroneous approval processes in streamlined systems. One solid use case is a passport-less future where we have a decentralised identity and proving your identity is much more straightforward but understanding the complexities of it in the backend technologies. Another less extreme example I had a conversation with in the past is the concept of decentralised marketplaces where P2P transactions will become a norm instead of paying the heavy retail tax. I enjoy talking to these people who are more problem and solution oriented, rather than those who are talking about extreme examples.\nI get that in the future there would be more and more Blockchain use cases that will happen, but they will be more niche and like slam-dunk use cases like consortiums: multiple parties agreeing on contracts. My view around it is very fractured as I see different angles around it depending on a lot of factors at play. I just know that the technology (as infrastructure and architecture) is here to stay, more business processes will be challenged and be a melting pot for innovative ideas (that may include Blockchain), the concept of cryptocurrency is here to stay but not betting that one specific coin will last in 200+ years (just like how social media is constantly developing). It\u0026rsquo;s still interesting to question where our lives will go because of technologies, including Blockchain.\nConclusion\n There are those who are in Blockchain because of money and cryptocurrencies. There are those who are curious about the technology behind blockchains. There are people who believes that Blockchain will change the world.  Are you into Blockchain?

Watching news on a television is a culture that a lot of people just grew up with as a \u0026ldquo;default.\u0026rdquo;\nHere are some of thoughts on why I don\u0026rsquo;t value reading or watching mainstream media anymore.\n The important news will come to you one way or the other. They are written or crafted to trigger emotions rather than inform about things. Too much information. We need less distractions.     Important news # Depending on what you call important, one way or the other, it\u0026rsquo;s going to get through you. Your families and friends will talk to you about it. Your co-workers will chat about it at the beginning of the meeting. Even when you\u0026rsquo;re just watching your favourite YouTube artists or gaming, the really important ones will come to you. If it\u0026rsquo;s a calamity or call to action alerts, the government have plans for it (I hope). So relax if you didn\u0026rsquo;t read the 08:00 AM latest news.\nAll these mainstream (and not mainstream) media outlets want your data and attention. It\u0026rsquo;s a day and age where attention is the most scarce resource in our time. The more you spend time consuming these content, the more they become valuable. So you have to re-think about this, are you just after a \u0026ldquo;1 liner factful information\u0026rdquo;, a tabular report, or a 2 pager essay about that story?\nOnly you can say what is really important news because only you knows what you really care about. Similar to how you manage your emails and tasks, it\u0026rsquo;s important you manage these news information as well.\nEmotional trigger # Unfortunately, a \u0026ldquo;good story\u0026rdquo; is thought provoking and captures the emotions of the consumer. My personal belief is news as information should be delivered as plain facts. But then again, it won\u0026rsquo;t sell to the mass audience.\nI feel itchy when news reporter have a very sad and emotional face when delivering a tragic story where people died, then in 20 seconds they can all talk about their new shoes and laugh about it.\nAs much as I want to say that those emotions and feelings get in to me, it does - eventually. It will then affect my mood, my work productivity, my relationship with people, etc etc. So having an understanding on your capacity and capability to handle these emotional triggers should be looked after.\nKnowing who you are such as understanding these emotional triggers can help you become much more productive in life. Feeling sad about a specific topic, what can you do within your reach to help make a difference? Maybe choose a charity to donate with. Volunteer to a non-profit. You can\u0026rsquo;t solve all the problems in the world, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need to solve world peace in 7 days to make a difference.\nToo much information # A lot of people dying of Covid19. Someone\u0026rsquo;s dog is missing. A celebrity had a Twitter clash with someone. A new movie is coming. All of them can be form of \u0026ldquo;news\u0026rdquo; and be of equal impact the more you spend time with them. You can consume hundreds or thousands of clips and links from all these mainstream media on a daily basis - there is no scarcity for these outlets.\nI think this boils down to knowing your intention from these media. If your intention is research, maybe listening to news is not the way to go? If your intention is to be \u0026ldquo;well-informed\u0026rdquo;, then you have to define what level and type of information you want to receive. It\u0026rsquo;s very important to know that these information, however small, will occupy a mental real-estate tax on your head, so it\u0026rsquo;s very important to focus on information that is relevant for you.\nI had a different point of view now of news after reading some history books. When you read a history book, you just look at the straight facts and happenings around it. There is no polarization. Unlike hearing or reading news that are half-baked, it\u0026rsquo;s still subject for bias and propaganda.\nConclusion # In the end, I just ignore the news (or the mainstream media). I don\u0026rsquo;t care about the newscasters, their \u0026ldquo;signatures\u0026rdquo;, their shoes or watches. If I need to know about a specific topic, I do my own due diligence to know enough - defined by my own parameters. I think it\u0026rsquo;s about time that we revisit the importance of these mainstream media to our lives.\n","date":"22 February 2021","permalink":"/blog/why-i-dont-read-or-watch-mainstream-media-that-much/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Ever since I was a kid, I was never really the person who watches the mainstream television to watch news.","title":"Why I don’t read or watch mainstream media that much"},{"content":"In someone\u0026rsquo;s employment life, she/he dreams of having her/his own company to beat the thoughts of having a manager or a boss. You know the promise of being your own boss, handling your own time, and $$$ - who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want that? It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;relatively\u0026rdquo; easy to establish a company compare to the last decades - thanks to technology. There are also a lot of avenues to profit from \u0026ldquo;the gig economy\u0026rdquo; that sometimes get big and would need a team to work on.   I believe that every person who dreamed of being self-employed should at least try it, given their circumstances. Obviously, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t advise people to quit their job and start a poor-planned business if there is a financial or family obligation at stake. But given if you have the capability and capacity to do so; plan it properly and just go for it.\nHere are 5 of my personal reasons why it\u0026rsquo;s beneficial to be self-employed or at least experience being one in your life.\nA real-world training of an MBA # This experience will be a trial by fire. Some would even argue that the money you put in to study an MBA might actually be better worth investing in a business instead. There are a lot of resources on how to run and manage a business (most of them are for free). If your business succeeds or becomes profitable, then you\u0026rsquo;ve done the right investment; and in case you fail with your venture, you would at least capture what didn\u0026rsquo;t work and how you can take better decisions next time.\nWhen I ventured having my business, I applied the 20-80 principle: I just need to know 20% of how it works, and I\u0026rsquo;ll learn the rest of 80% along the way. It\u0026rsquo;s important to find the balance between \u0026ldquo;I know nothing, should I do it?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;I feel like I don\u0026rsquo;t know 100% about it\u0026rdquo;. So, for example, starting a business around beauty and car products is a bad idea on my end because I know less than 20% of it.\nHowever, if you are venturing on a familiar domain, such as past work and jobs, then that might actually work. I\u0026rsquo;ve been in the technology consulting for the last decade, and I have enough experience on my belt to deliver successful project outcomes. So starting a business around this made sense, because I have over 20% knowledge and experience on how it works, I am just learning the rest of 80% like doing sales, marketing, white label products, managing remote workers, collaboration with partners, accounting, etc.\nYou experience to do the \u0026ldquo;necessary evils\u0026rdquo; # Year after year, you deal with expenses, taxes, and cash flows. I think this can also apply to your personal finances, but you become more invested in managing it. The simple coffee expense can become much more visible. This allows you to experience firsthand some of those paper-works and signatures required to file for your quarterly or yearly declarations.\nIf organising these is too much for you, or taking too much of your time, then hire an accountant. I have an accountant, she\u0026rsquo;s exceptional. She handles 80% to 90% of the work involved in our accounting books. Even if you have an accountant, the actual money that goes in and out of the company is still for you to handle - carefully. So having that sense of responsibility brings up financial literacy on your end.\nThis knowledge and experience will become handy if you plan to go back to being employed. You would have a better understanding on how to balance expenses and sales, like \u0026ldquo;Why can\u0026rsquo;t I have the best super fast laptop for work?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my salary delayed again?\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s one step closer to financial freedom # As an employee working in a technology firm (or actually any company), have you ever thought that maybe you can cash in all the money that clients pay for your service? Well, the answer is yes. That\u0026rsquo;s the whole point of being self-employed. You\u0026rsquo;re willing to do the rest of the functions of your former employer and get the maximum benefit out of it. You\u0026rsquo;ll remove a lot of the overhead costs of the people in the company that translate little value for you. Being an employee brings you a \u0026ldquo;subjective stability\u0026rdquo; but doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you much control, being self-employed means having a lot of control but with a higher risk (and potential reward).\nIn the beginning of your business, you will have no need for a complicated HR structure, cultivating company culture, hierarchy of managers (and middle-managers). You focus on making the company profitable with the least amount of expenses. You build a company, so that in a few years\u0026rsquo; time you can exit. Exiting means you already gathered enough resources to venture for something new, or the company became big (or get acquired) that you just want to benefit from it without working hands-on day-to-day.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re motivated to make money, then it\u0026rsquo;s a straightforward decision that you really have to start-up a business. It\u0026rsquo;s very few who actually get rich from being employed. Not all people who start up a business becomes rich. There are different \u0026ldquo;survivorship bias\u0026rdquo; on both ends, so be careful. The advantage of being self-employed is at least you have a very flexible control on where you want your career or \u0026ldquo;making money\u0026rdquo; take you.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll realise your \u0026ldquo;real worth\u0026rdquo; # Once you venture out in the market, you will understand how much is your actual worth by 2 fundamental principles:\n How much do you think you should earn from your service or product? How much do you think clients and customers would pay for it?  The latter being more important than the former. The former is more around building hypothesis and assumptions based from your own experience or research, the latter is more around actual negotiation skills and market margins.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re trying to build a product, you\u0026rsquo;ll do the basic maths on how much time you\u0026rsquo;re putting in it. Does it make sense to hire more people? Do you need funding from investors? Or maybe outsource some non-core services? How much should I sell the product for?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re doing a service business, you\u0026rsquo;ll ask yourself how much should you charge a client. Are they willing to pay $20,000 per day? Or maybe $2000? $200? Should I do fixed-price contracts? How do you scale it so that you get paid in full, but still deliver the expected outcome? All those questions become more relevant to you as you learn to value your actual effort and time.\nMore opportunity to inspire and touch lives # I think this is one of the best reasons to start a company. You have the option to help others, whether that\u0026rsquo;s through giving people jobs (or gigs), doing not-for-profit work, company donations, etc. Or simply because you have more money, you\u0026rsquo;ll have more options to buy from your local butcher or fresh market and not buy from the big companies.\nYou will meet many people on the journey, and you will share a lot of stories with them. You will write more about your struggles and lessons (like this). Having a company gives you a responsibility to not just think about yourself, you think of a bigger goal. What will your company look like in 5 years\u0026rsquo; time? How will it affect the surrounding people: your family, your friends, and your peers? How will it affect you?\nThere is a common misconception that once you become self-employed, always plan for it to be a 1,000+ people\u0026rsquo;s company or a multi-million business. Although that\u0026rsquo;s something worth aiming in the long run, if your only reason for starting a business is money and influence, you might also consider challenging \u0026ldquo;the growth.\u0026rdquo; Is that what you really want? Well, you would know - it\u0026rsquo;s your business!\nConclusion #  Starting a business is your actual \u0026ldquo;on the job\u0026rdquo; training of an MBA. You\u0026rsquo;ll experience to do the necessities: accounting, sales, marketing, and managing people. It\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to make more money. You\u0026rsquo;ll value how much your time converts into a dollar figure. There\u0026rsquo;s opportunity to help others.  If you have the right resources and plans to start a business, just go for it. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn the rest of it along the way. You will go pass by the \u0026ldquo;What if I\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo;. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, then at least you tried, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not yet the right time.\nLet me know your story. Have you started your own business? Do you want to start a business? What\u0026rsquo;s holding you back?\n","date":"27 January 2021","permalink":"/blog/why-you-should-experience-being-self-employed/","section":"Blogs","summary":"In someone\u0026rsquo;s employment life, she/he dreams of having her/his own company to beat the thoughts of having a manager or a boss.","title":"Why you should experience being self-employed"},{"content":"One of the colossal beasts that all knowledge workers fight time and time again is procrastination. This is when you know you should work, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough willpower to do it. You can\u0026rsquo;t code, you can\u0026rsquo;t do that design document, you can\u0026rsquo;t write that next blog post\u0026hellip; the list goes on. Here are 5 of my usual methods when I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in that limbo.\n   Avoid Distractions # The first and obvious thing that you have to do is to avoid distraction. Maybe it was the distraction that caused your procrastination. You opened Twitter and Facebook while brewing a coffee, and you got distracted straight on. Then the simple choices become available: watching Netflix \u0026amp; YouTube, the infinity pools of Social media; then you get sucked to that void. These take willpower, and if you let it get to you early on, then it will stick with you until it depletes your energy.\nI think it boils down into two things:\n  Be intentional about how you use these devices, apps, and sites. As part of my journey to Digital Intentionality, I\u0026rsquo;m researching on more ways you can let these tools be in your favour, instead of being a consumer of it. Some simple tricks I\u0026rsquo;ve developed lately are: Don\u0026rsquo;t watch Netflix on your phone or PCs, use a TV. Use your work machine purely as work machine, don\u0026rsquo;t install all those mobile-sync apps such as Messaging. Be clear on how you use your phone: calls, messages, calendars - that\u0026rsquo;s all I use it for right now. Only my kindle is in my bedroom because it\u0026rsquo;s a place to sleep and read.\n  If you can\u0026rsquo;t help it, force yourself to not really do it. Use the Screen time limits of your mobile phones. Install time management software such as Freedom. Pay a fine to a jar every time you opened social media when you know you should do something else. Uninstall all those apps. Log-out to all of them. Change your passwords to something you can\u0026rsquo;t remember (use password managers.) Make it hard and punishing for you to access those sites and apps.\n  The key word here is \u0026ldquo;avoid.\u0026rdquo; I know from experience that it\u0026rsquo;s really impossible to get rid of these distractions. One way or the other, something will distract you, just be mindful of it - do some tricks that will force your brain to avoid such distractions.\nJust do one small thing - really well # Some days are dragging, with the mix of unscheduled work, house errands, and personal commitments, these really take a toll on your willpower for that day. Obviously, some of these things are really important and it\u0026rsquo;s probably not the best idea to just ignore them. What I do in these days is to just work on one thing and do it well - or sometimes, really just doing it regardless of outcome.\nI had a misconception in the past I have to work tirelessly in big sprints to achieve meaningful goals. That\u0026rsquo;s probably why it\u0026rsquo;s also daunting to work on things if you know you need to work in long hours to finish it, hence you go to the straightforward route of distractions instead.\nAs I mature and get more experience in the field and life, I realise that the successful outcome of a project is the summation (with compound interests) of the day-to-day actions that you do. It\u0026rsquo;s not the 1 straight weekend of work that will make a project successful, but the small iterations you do daily. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to look at the screen for 8 hours straight to develop a feature; I have to work on it, little by little. Few minutes to solve step 1, few minutes to solve step 2, and so on.\nThere are things that you can\u0026rsquo;t control, you can only react properly on these situations. If you let these drag you down for the rest of the day, week, month, or year, then you will get nowhere.\nWork with a peer # I think that the solo heroism era is now over. A lot of really successful project outcomes are derived by teams or individuals who leverage peer reviews. This is probably the simplest trick to work on \u0026ldquo;that imaginary deadline.\u0026rdquo; If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a deadline in to something, the easiest trick in the book is to commit to a peer (someone you trust and \u0026ldquo;get you\u0026rdquo;) when she/he can expect to review what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nThis amplifies that you\u0026rsquo;re not just doing it for yourself, but someone else on the other side of the fence values what you do and will give you a constructive feedback. Since the buddy or peer-system is built on trust, you rarely want to disappoint them, there is a certain dosage of stress (in a form of challenge most of the time) that you imbue as part of this commitment.\nThis is often not the same as committing to a manager or stakeholder, as they might bite you if you don\u0026rsquo;t deliver! - again just enough dosage of stress is enough.\nSchedule things # One struggle I find disturbing is once I use a ToDo list, the list eventually gets really long, and it\u0026rsquo;s overwhelming on how much you\u0026rsquo;re not accomplishing. I use different techniques to handle them, but one thing that really stands out is \u0026ldquo;if ain\u0026rsquo;t scheduled, it ain\u0026rsquo;t happening\u0026rdquo; mentality. These lists often are a \u0026ldquo;maybe lists\u0026rdquo; for me, I just place them there so it\u0026rsquo;s there when I need them. When I decide that it\u0026rsquo;s time to do that something, I schedule it.\nThere are numerous advantages of using this approach:\n  Once it\u0026rsquo;s scheduled, it means you\u0026rsquo;re going to allocate time to \u0026ldquo;really\u0026rdquo; do it.\n  If your priority changes on that day or time, you just reschedule it.\n  It\u0026rsquo;s easy to visualise the hours. Maybe 1 hour is too long, maybe you only need 15 minutes. Maybe the task is too big for an 8 hour, and should be split into different subtasks.\n  If you don\u0026rsquo;t finish it on that specific timeframe, then you know that the time is not enough, you will then schedule another time to do it.\n  Bonus tip: This also works best to avoid meetings. If you work in a team with transparent calendars, put in the tasks number / identifier in that calendar event. 🙂\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be hard on yourself # Sometimes when I feel like I didn\u0026rsquo;t get that productive on that day, I develop an inner voice doubting that I could have done better or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time to give up my career. This is normal. This happens because you really care about what you do, you\u0026rsquo;re deeply invested in it. There are many scientific studies in psychoneuroimmunology on why this happens to us. One outstanding audiobook recommendation I have for you to listen to is: I Know What to Do, So Why Don\u0026rsquo;t I Do It? By Dr. Nick Hall.\nEstablish a method that works for you, so you don\u0026rsquo;t hurt yourself mentally (and maybe physically) when this happens. Whenever this experience happens to me, I usually look at my old pictures and get the sense of nostalgia on how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come since then. I also look at some goals I\u0026rsquo;ve set in the past, and become proud of how I achieved (or overachieved) some of them, or how some goals are silly now that I\u0026rsquo;m looking at it. I also go for a run or practice some mindful meditation.\nEven the really greats like Marcus Aurelius, Victor Hugo, and a lot of the Top 1% idols that you follow, they all experienced a dosage of procrastination from time to time, but it\u0026rsquo;s their habits and goals that keeps them motivated to move forward. So don\u0026rsquo;t be hard on yourself. Go for a walk, play a game, chat with friends, sleep, eat that baklava; whatever suit you to regain that willpower - do it so you get energised again, just don\u0026rsquo;t be hard on yourself.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to this with a quote I really like from Marcus Aurelius:\n Concentrate every minute on doing what\u0026rsquo;s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can, if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that\u0026rsquo;s all even the gods can ask of you. -Marcus Aurelius\n ","date":"14 January 2021","permalink":"/blog/how-to-beat-procrastination/","section":"Blogs","summary":"One of the colossal beasts that all knowledge workers fight time and time again is procrastination.","title":"How to beat procrastination"},{"content":"Before 2018, I was never a book reader. Reading a book seems like a chore to me. I can barely finish a chapter. I always had that internal conflict (possibly based from childhood experience) that only \u0026ldquo;the smart people\u0026rdquo; can read books. Another factor is, I\u0026rsquo;ve always associated books to \u0026ldquo;school\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;academia\u0026rdquo; that felt like an enclosed culture that didn\u0026rsquo;t really synced in to me. Also, I\u0026rsquo;d rather watch a film or TV series than read a 300 to 500 pager book - because of cinematics. It\u0026rsquo;s a much more immersive experience than doing the effort of \u0026ldquo;reading intentionally.\u0026rdquo; Also, growing up maybe I just didn\u0026rsquo;t find \u0026ldquo;reading book\u0026rdquo; as something cool amongst teenagers and the society I used to live.\n   I\u0026rsquo;ve read some more technical books (AKA glanced to relevant resources) but not really absorbing most of it - just like the textbooks I had in school. Around 2017, I\u0026rsquo;m noticing that there has been a big decline of quality movies and TV shows, or maybe I just got burned out from it. It\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to find unique (or interesting) movie plots or immersion beyond CGIs and occasional laughs.\nIt was 2018 when I decided to really read. I started from the familiar grounds of Software Engineering and Startups. I\u0026rsquo;ve read most of the \u0026ldquo;Top 10 must read books for Software Engineers\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Top 10 books for Startup Founders\u0026rdquo;, and those cliche lists. It was \u0026ldquo;The Phoenix Project\u0026rdquo; by Gene Kim that really made it a fun experience for me. It\u0026rsquo;s a fiction novel that romanticise the horrors of IT operations and how they could thrive from it. I also enjoyed \u0026ldquo;The Martian\u0026rdquo; by Andy Weir and \u0026ldquo;Read Player One\u0026rdquo; by Ernest Cline. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve probably read close to 100 books. The books I\u0026rsquo;ve read in two years are actually more than the books I\u0026rsquo;ve read in my first two decades since I learned to read.\nI would like to highlight that for others we take book reading for granted, but in fact it\u0026rsquo;s actually a privilege. I\u0026rsquo;m fortunate enough at this point that I can simply buy a book either online or at a bookstore without really \u0026ldquo;saving\u0026rdquo; for it. The price of a Kindle device or buying spree $100 book bundles wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt. Also, some books, I can expense in my business. My thinking is that, if it helps me one way or the other in the future, then I should buy it as an \u0026ldquo;investment\u0026rdquo; rather than an \u0026ldquo;expense.\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;re privileged to buy a book or reading devices, do it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a love-hate relationship with Kindle (the device) or actually any reading apps for a while now. Sometimes reading on Kindle doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for me, and sometimes it does. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain what works for me soon. I\u0026rsquo;ve had 3 Kindle devices and probably attempted to install it to all my phones and tablets. I think in any form of habit that you\u0026rsquo;re trying to cultivate, there is a certain level of learning curve and product-fitting on what works for you best.\nHow I read books #  As part of my journey to Digital Intentionality, I don\u0026rsquo;t use my mobile phone anymore to read a book. Two major reasons are: Too much distractions; and I enjoy reading before I sleep - so bringing the phone in bed is a call for disaster. I read a physical book when I can and when I want to read that book in that form. For some reasons, there are books that are superb to read physically because it immersed you with \u0026ldquo;exclusivity\u0026rdquo;. An example is reading the bible, I\u0026rsquo;d rather open an actual bible than to read it from an app. I read on my Kindle with a low-light setting before I sleep. Sometimes I fell asleep while reading, and would read again first thing in the morning. I read on my Kindle if I know I have to wait for something. For example, while in a car or waiting for an appointment. I use my MacBook Air when I have to actively take notes (I type faster than writing) while reading a technical book. I occasionally read on my iPad if the book is filled with immersive graphics. I listen to audiobooks when I am doing tasks that don\u0026rsquo;t require me to think a lot. Examples are: running \u0026amp; cycling, chores, walking in commutes.  How I know what to read: #  If a person I know recommends a non-fiction book to me, I\u0026rsquo;ll buy it straight to Kindle. It takes a certain effort to finish a non-fiction book, and one way or the other, it affects that person, hence she/he would like to recommend it. I used to base it from \u0026ldquo;a list\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;best sellers\u0026rdquo; or the really popular ones. I think that\u0026rsquo;s fine, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re just starting out the habit. These days, I\u0026rsquo;m more intentional about what books to read depending on what Stoicism, so I already have a specific set of expectations on what to get in reading a book - rather than the \u0026ldquo;surprise me\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;feel high\u0026rdquo;. There are books that are \u0026ldquo;light-reading\u0026rdquo;, most of the words are not technical and you can read it even if your toddler is jumping around the bed. I just simply read them for the sake of reading it. I enjoy some trash novels from time to time. 🙂 I also use the 10% principle. If you\u0026rsquo;re at the 10% mark and really struggling, try skipping a chapter or revisit the table of contents. If it\u0026rsquo;s really such a job for you to read it, abandon it. Revisit it later if it becomes relevant to you at that specific point in time. There are times I actually Google or watch a video on YouTube about the book or the author before reading. This just paints a better picture of the author, her/his thoughts, and intentions. Also, the easiest way to detect b***t. Lately, I\u0026rsquo;m now avoiding the \u0026ldquo;glorified blog posts\u0026rdquo; books. You know, there\u0026rsquo;s a blog about it. Then the author just double-downed on that topic, find repetitive examples, put more narratives into it, but the value and quality density is just the same as that blog post.  There are a lot more reasons on why read books. I\u0026rsquo;m just adding a bit to that force by this post. There are many researches that support it, there are a lot of \u0026ldquo;successful people\u0026rdquo; who recommend reading, you know you should do it. Do it \u0026ldquo;just because.\u0026rdquo; If you struggle, let me know. Maybe I can help.\nSo in conclusion #  Get out from the inner conflict of reading a book. Whatever past bias that you have, fight it and get rid of it. Read books you enjoy or you know that can affect you. Don\u0026rsquo;t think of it like the way it is in schools. A teacher won\u0026rsquo;t give you a failed mark if you don\u0026rsquo;t finish it. It takes time to find the right book reading method that suites you. Also, maybe it keeps changing. What\u0026rsquo;s important is you keep trying.  What are the books that you would like to recommend? Let me know.\n","date":"8 January 2021","permalink":"/blog/you-should-read-books-you-know-you-should/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Before 2018, I was never a book reader.","title":"You should read books, you know you should"},{"content":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are trending topics right now. In 2021, there are countless of ways to have a form of \u0026ldquo;AI\u0026rdquo; in your apps and platforms. A lot of companies from startups to software giants offer services that relate to this space. I spent the last 2 years exploring this space, and I still swimming my way as the movements in this area are quick and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep up.\nMicrosoft is a leader in this space, specially in AI for Enterprise, as they offer a variety of options depending on your needs and choice of approach. In the Microsoft Cloud space (Azure, Microsoft 365, and other related products), it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to get confused as there is no \u0026ldquo;one tool to rule them all\u0026rdquo; as a market fit. In my experience, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really one silver bullet \u0026ldquo;yet\u0026rdquo; in this game, since unique problems require different approaches. The actual value of AI is when it solves a problem, and technologies and platforms successfully enable this outcome.\nThis is my attempt to create an ultimate rundown of navigating AI in the Microsoft Cloud. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with platforms that allow Data Scientists develop ML models. There are times I need to wear this \u0026ldquo;Data Scientist\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Data Engineer\u0026rdquo; hat when some ML models that we are developing are relatively common, but some really difficult ML problems require a lot of research, experimentation, deep-expertise, and resources. Having a unified and seamless workspace is what you need in order to be productive in creating and training models.\n   Machine Learning Workspace #    Azure Machine Learning # This is an end-to-end platform and workspace for all bespoke AI and ML development. This platform has the balance of flexibility but, not too general, as this still taps on with specific \u0026ldquo;fit-for-purpose\u0026rdquo; ML tools.\n Notebooks. Arguably, the modern way to deal with ML, is by using a Jupyter notebook. Azure ML allows you to use the same experience as you have with any other Jupyter server instance, but with roles and underlying infrastructure abstracted. ML Designer. The previous iteration of this is called \u0026ldquo;ML Studio\u0026rdquo;. This drag-and-drop flow-chart-like capability is also available in Azure ML in case you prefer this rather than using notebooks. Automated ML. Some ML problems like simple classification can easily be captured using AutoML. This feature focuses on the common problems that may have already been solved before, so you can focus your team\u0026rsquo;s energy on the harder problems. MLOps. This is one step further in making your ML life-cycle more mature. Having this maturity of proper version control using Git and workflows allow you to automate training and experimentation in CI/CD fashion - just like how you stage web applications.  There are a lot of other things that Azure ML can do especially in the integrations space. Mature and companies with dedicated AI team(s) should seriously explore this. If you want to learn more about Azure ML, click here.\n   Data Science VM # Well, in all honesty, you can use any Virtual Machine for your ML workflow. Actually, any machine at all from any cloud or hardware provider. However, unless you have DSC (desired state configuration) setup per instance, then you have to install Python, Jupyter, Anaconda, etc. DSVM is a ready-made image that comes with a lot of pre-installed tools that an AI scientist or engineer would use. The beauty of this approach is you have full control of that machine and can turn it off anytime. Learn more.\n   Notebooks in VS Code # Sometimes you prefer to do some simple experiments locally on your machine instead of a hosted Jupyter kernel instance. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re using a beefy desktop and want to experiment on simple models and small datasets, then having that offline experience of Jupyter notebook is available in VS Code. Learn more.\nBonus: Notebooks extension is also available on Github Codespaces. Go explore. 😉\nComplements with MLOps # The next part I want to cover are products and services that are \u0026ldquo;related\u0026rdquo; to ML, but it\u0026rsquo;s not the primary focus. One way or the other, you can create an ML model based from a dataset and use it for any purpose that it may serve.\nApache Spark™ # The reason I would argue that any service related to Spark™ would fall into the \u0026ldquo;big data\u0026rdquo; category and as a byproduct, can host an ML server that comes with Python based frameworks (MLlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn to name a few.)\n   Azure Databricks # Databricks creates a unified environment for your big data analytics. Similar to Azure ML, this is more than just a Spark™ cluster. It also comes with notebooks, managed infrastructure, and native integrations with other Azure services. I would argue that Databricks can really be your prime-time production workspace, but then again, it\u0026rsquo;s more positioned as \u0026ldquo;more big data, ML as a byproduct.\u0026rdquo; Learn more.\n   Azure HDInsight # It also has a managed Spark™ cluster capability hence comes with MLlib (machine learning library), but beyond that it also has support for Hadoop, Kafka, HBase. HDInsight is really useful in \u0026ldquo;crunching enormous set of unstructured/semi-structured data\u0026rdquo; and is more for the big data scenarios. The ML capabilities are currently limited. Learn more.\n   .NET for Apache Spark™ # The popular ways to interface with a Spark™ instance is by using Python and Scala. The .NET team created an open-source high performance bindings that is compliant with .NET Standard that will allow you to perform Spark™ operations in any .NET apps using C# or F#. Learn more.\n   Azure Synapse Analytics # This is the new kid in the block that developed from Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Similar to Databricks, Synapse also offers an end-to-end pipeline and workflows for your modern data warehouse needs. Data warehousing has developed from traditional \u0026ldquo;housing of data\u0026rdquo; to creating unified and real-time data analytics. Synapse really shines when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a lot (even petabyte) of diverse and unstructured data and wants to gain meaningful insights out of it. As part of this approach, Synapse also overlaps (and co-exists) with ML services. You have the option to use the ML capabilities of the dedicated pools of Spark™ and SQL instances or integrate with Azure ML and Power BI. I would argue that Synapse is \u0026ldquo;more data analytics, ML as a byproduct.\u0026rdquo; Learn more.\n   Power BI # This is your go-to tool when creating meaningful dashboards and reports from your data. As part of this, Power BI also comes with features that allow you to go beyond visualisation like creating semantic (structured table-like) data models. In the ML side of things, Power BI comes with \u0026ldquo;Dataflows\u0026rdquo; that allows you to select a data source to generate and train an ML model with \u0026ldquo;AI Insights\u0026rdquo; using AutoML under the hood. This works in some scenarios such as time-series forecasting. I would say that Power BI is \u0026ldquo;more data visualisation, ML and Big Data as byproducts.\u0026rdquo; Learn more.\nAI Apps and Agents # In this section, I will cover \u0026ldquo;AI infused\u0026rdquo; functionalities that are more application-driven. These products and services are very powerful as these have the least barrier of entry and abstracts some complexities of AI/ML operations such as setting up infrastructure, access to deep knowledge of AI scientists, and sometimes cost efficiency to name a few.\n   Azure Cognitive Services # These set of services allow you to add intelligence to your apps. Throughout the years, it has developed in to a lot of general purpose service offerings and specialised AI \u0026amp; ML use-cases that fit your business needs or problems you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve. The beauty of Cognitive Services is that it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to get started and a lot of it can be accessed in either a form of API, Native SDKs (.NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, etc), or intuitive graphical portals. The deployment model is also very flexible, from hosted consumption (pay-per-hit) to containerised instances.\n Vision. If you want to create a simple facial recognition system, this is something to explore. You can even do advanced OCR (Optical Character recognitions) like Form Recognizer. Analyse videos using Video Indexer. And analysing image contents using Computer and Custom vision. Speech. There are a lot of things that you can do with Speech. From simple speech-to-text \u0026amp; text-to-speech, to real-time translations of a voice. Imagine speaking a language or having your own narration that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound \u0026ldquo;too robot like.\u0026rdquo; There are a lot of exciting things happening in this space that I am involved too, so watch this space. Language. In parallel with speech, Language also provides a lot of texts related insights, mostly coming from unstructured texts. From text-to-text translations (even a document file) to complex NLP (Natural Language Processing) problems with Language Understanding. Decision. This set of services allows you to create ML models to enable smarter decisions. From simple anomaly detectors, content moderator, content personaliser, and metrics advisor.  They add more services from time to time, as some emerging AI disciplines are becoming democratised. To learn more about Azure Cognitive Services, click here.\n   Knowledge Mining # Sometimes these services are the things we take for granted on how easy it is now to perform, but it would take a lot of research and resources to do decades ago. A more evolved form of cognitive service is a new offering called Knowledge Mining with Azure Cognitive Search. Knowledge mining is an emerging discipline in AI where you use a combination of intelligent services to quickly create insights from your company data sources. Imagine ingesting all of your historical documents, database records, other unstructured data and explore meaningful insights about it - create an audit \u0026amp; risk compliance, managing contracts, customer support, and a lot more! Learn more.\n   Azure Bot Service # This is a managed service that allows you to create bots (like chatbots). This also allows you to integrate and deploy to popular channels such as Teams, Slack, Skype, Telegram. Together with the service itself, it also comes with a composer and framework to integrate with various Azure services such as Cognitive Services - Language. You can completely do all of this without code! Learn more.\n   ML.NET # If you want to create custom ML models using C# or F# without leaving the ecosystem (say interop with Python or R), ML.NET is a viable option for you. It also allows you to leverage popular libraries such as Infer.NET and TensorFlow. You can also use AutoML for you to build, train, and deploy ML models. Learn more.\nBonus: Outside of ML.NET, F# has been long used for Data Science. There have been a lot of development in this space, like using SciSharrp Stack. Learn more.\n   AI Builder # It\u0026rsquo;s a Microsoft Power Platform feature that allows you to build ML models by intuitively connecting to a data source. The approach is very similar of Power BI\u0026rsquo;s dataflows. It uses an intuitive drag-and-drop graphical tool to connect data sources and build an ML model. This is very useful if you want to create simple ML models beyond consuming Cognitive Services APIs. Learn more.\nIntegrations # There are hundreds or probably even thousands of way to integrate a form of AI and ML to anything. From the use of RESTful APIs, to adapters, to wrapped libraries, etc. The following are worth mentioning, as these integrations are well established and have a lot of synergy when implementing it.\n   SQL Server # I think even before the hype of \u0026ldquo;AI/ML\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;Big Data,\u0026rdquo; a lot of companies have already implemented intelligence or analytics to their data sets in their SQL Server clusters. Particular to ML, SQL server started offering Machine Learning Services since SQL Server 2017. Using the same SQL Server cluster, you can execute Python and R scripts directly to SQL Server. So there are scenarios where use TensorFlow using the database as the direct source for your training model. This approach is very useful if most of your data sources are already aggregated in SQL Server. Learn more.\n   Power Platform # More than what you can do with dataflows in Power BI and AI builder for Power Automate and Power Apps, the Power Platform itself can be in a form serving ML for users. Power BI can integrate with Azure ML \u0026amp; Azure Synapse Analytics, where Power BI focuses on data visualisation. Power Apps can input and output data straight from Azure Cognitive Services. You can automate some internal workflow in Power Automate that integrates with Azure Cognitive Search. The beauty of these approaches is the ease to infuse AI or ML to these services, while the underlying Security and Infrastructure complexities are abstracted or inherited - an example would be Authentication and how easily it is to deploy and consume these apps internally.\nBonus: Power Virtual Agents is something also worth looking at.\n   Microsoft 365 # Similar to Power Platform, the suite of Microsoft 365 includes (but not limited to) Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook, Yammer, and Teams. These products and services comes with some really cool \u0026ldquo;AI-infused\u0026rdquo; features. In PowerPoint alone, it comes with features like \u0026ldquo;Design Ideas\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Presenter Coach\u0026rdquo;. Beyond what\u0026rsquo;s already baked-in and actively being developed by the product teams, creating extensions and infusing a form of AI or ML is also possible. If you think about it, one way or the other, you might also deal with Excel and CSVs in your ML workflow.\n   Logic App, Azure Function, and Azure Data Factory # If you\u0026rsquo;re already in the Microsoft ecosystem, one way or the other you can use LA, AF, or ADF to transfer or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) from one end to the other. Logic App shines when there are built-in connectors available. Azure Function shine best if you would require a custom coding but want to abstract the underlying infrastructure. Azure Data Factory is best when you want to create custom data pipelines, mostly involving a Data Lake or Synapse.\nLinks: Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure Data Factory\n   Dynamics CRM with Customer 360 # The last one I want to mention in integration is Dynamics CRM with Customer 360. With the power of Microsoft Graph, you can activate AI-powered insights about your customers. It gives you AI-driven recommendations that will help your business create more data-informed decisions. Let\u0026rsquo;s say someone bought something, you may want to also recommend this item as an added bundle. The innovations of AI in retail are endless!\nHardware and Infrastructure # Lastly, Azure also offers various infrastructure options in different parts of ML lifecycle. Obviously, you can pretty much spin up an Azure VM to use it for anything, however there are also specific offerings that are specific for ML \u0026amp; AI use-cases.\n   FPGA \u0026amp; GPU on Azure VMs # When training an ML model, it takes a lot of compute power to deal with a large (and complex) data-sets. You have the option to use virtual machines that has FPGA \u0026amp; GPUs, provided you write your script to target those configurations, to train models faster instead of using CPUs. Learn more.\n   Azure Containers # Sometimes, when you want to use your ML model and embed it to your applications, you package it in a Docker container. It\u0026rsquo;s probably the easiest way to make sure you have all the dependencies needed in order to run your model in \u0026ldquo;inference\u0026rdquo; mode. Azure provides a lot of options in this space, from:\n Azure Container Registry - a general purpose storage of your container images. Very useful if it\u0026rsquo;s versioned well according to your MLOps (Git). Azure Container Instance (ACI) - this is very lean if you want a standalone or short-lived workloads on your service. Azure App Service for Containers - similar to ACI, but just uses a different hosting plan underneath. It\u0026rsquo;s useful if you prefer to use an App Service Plan and the model is lean. Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) - if you have more complex orchestrations such as various consumer services. This is also the most flexible option (and arguably more complex configuration.)  Bonus: You can also create an advanced ML Training pipeline with AKS such as highly scalable training and inference clusters.\nTo learn more on how to train a model using a custom Docker image, click here.\n   Azure Stack # There are use-cases where you need to perform AI workloads outside of the cloud. The common example are videos. It\u0026rsquo;s not very ideal to send videos over cloud while you\u0026rsquo;re disconnected or using your on-premises data centre. I believe that Hybrid Cloud is the future and we should not store everything on cloud. I worked on Azure Stack Edge, and I\u0026rsquo;m amazed on the performance that it offers. Learn more.\nConclusion #  Azure ML is a good end-to-end ML workspace. You have a lot of options where to use a Jupyter Notebook Azure Cognitive Services is the easiest way to start your AI journey. There are a lot of options for infrastructure from specialised hardware to containers and edge devices. There are myriads of overlaps and synergies with various Azure products or services. You just have to choose which suits you best.  I hope you enjoyed my rundown of all things AI and ML in the Microsoft Cloud. Did I miss anything?

A 10X Engineer? You know some who are \u0026ldquo;extraordinary\u0026rdquo;. What do you mean by extraordinary? I\u0026rsquo;ve always had some thoughts (all of us do) around it, but my understanding and opinion of it is now much more concrete. Actually, this applies not only to being a developer, but to any other career or profession that you\u0026rsquo;re in.\n   I believe there is a big problem with polarisation in the industry. We only look at the further right of the bell curve. We disregard that there are average and less than average people.\nBecause of technology, it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to get swayed by social media about \u0026ldquo;the extraordinary people\u0026rdquo;, the top 1% of the 1% of the population who are romanticise about being great.\nYou see someone who is extremely bright and started programming with his dad\u0026rsquo;s Commodore 64 at age 4, and you feel bad that you didn\u0026rsquo;t start learning to program at an age of 4 + N days. Someone developed a lot of programs and exited with millions at a young age, while you were pre-occupied with something else (like playing video games with friends). A young chief executive of a multi-national company in his 20s. The list goes on. If you\u0026rsquo;re not \u0026ldquo;like them\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo;, then you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; average. There is nothing wrong with being an average.\nUnfortunately, a lot of companies set these unrealistic standards in order to hire only the \u0026ldquo;top 5% of the world\u0026rdquo; but maybe you can intern with them (with a minimum wage or no pay at all) and if you \u0026ldquo;wear multiple hats\u0026rdquo; and work hard enough (90+ hours per week), maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll be extraordinary too, just like them. Maybe if you attend these conferences, read 100+ technology books, use only command lines and no mouse; you\u0026rsquo;ll be extraordinary too.\nYou buy into the false belief that there is a hero waiting inside you to unleash. A lot of the self-help industry and HR culture are really selling these \u0026ldquo;feel good\u0026rdquo; trainings like pancakes. I believe that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be extraordinary at work to be a good person. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t let some random book or article tell you if you\u0026rsquo;re not good just because you don\u0026rsquo;t know set SMART goals every week in your job or career. Are you actually fun to work with? Do people around you get inspired and learn from you?\nSome metrics are BS anyway. How do you actually measure an extraordinary developer or software engineer in the first place? Sometimes this also gets very weird when you join a company with a weird performance review process.\nWe fall into the \u0026ldquo;vanity metrics\u0026rdquo; trap where we want to find some numbers to compare to measure performance. Some common and unjustified vanity metrics I experienced:\n The number of line of codes you\u0026rsquo;ve written. The number of unit tests that passed. I can write hundreds of \u0026ldquo;not so meaningful\u0026rdquo; tests. The ratio of pass/fail builds. The number of commits. Time spent \u0026ldquo;online\u0026rdquo; or in the office.  We sometimes base it from someone who is \u0026ldquo;above\u0026rdquo; the rest.\n Someone has a higher salary than you. Someone gets awarded with a diamond plaque and you\u0026rsquo;re not. Someone has a \u0026ldquo;Chief,\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Head of,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Senior Lead Manager Global Distinguished Architect Black Belt,\u0026rdquo; title in their profiles and you\u0026rsquo;re still stuck with \u0026ldquo;Associate Junior Assistant Team Lead Secondment,\u0026rdquo;.  You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be jealous of that person. That person is unique. He or she is not you. Unless you want to be that person as a \u0026ldquo;wholesale\u0026rdquo; and not just some selective things about him or her, then you need to get rid of that jealousy. Here\u0026rsquo;s a good quote from Naval.\n You can’t cherry-pick the things you envy so much about the other person. You would have to take a 180-degree swap with that person. You would have to take her age, her family history, her struggles, her failures, her medical conditions, her pains, her parents, her friends, everything. And lose everything you have built and leave everyone you love behind. And unless you are totally comfortable with that swap, you shouldn’t be envious. -Naval Ravikant\n At any company, you don\u0026rsquo;t always work with \u0026ldquo;extraordinary people\u0026rdquo; and not all the people in the world are \u0026ldquo;extraordinary\u0026rdquo;. We design and create applications so that \u0026ldquo;ordinary\u0026rdquo; people can use them and potentially make their lives meaningful, and they become more productive at work. The actual value of your work is about the outcome it creates and not how complex the technology you use.\nHowever, a huge disclaimer, that there is a big difference in being average and those side of the fences of \u0026ldquo;not even trying\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;complacent\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;come-what-may\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;the Mr excuse I can\u0026rsquo;t finish this module in 5 years\u0026rdquo;. You know what I mean - don\u0026rsquo;t you? Don\u0026rsquo;t be that person. The key message here is aspire to be a better developer, better than who you were in the past; but don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad if you are not extraordinary.\nCouple of years ago, I was \u0026ldquo;that guy\u0026rdquo;, you know, the guy who would look down at people because they\u0026rsquo;re not technical enough, they don\u0026rsquo;t spend extreme hours learning technology X, those who are not \u0026ldquo;as good as me\u0026rdquo;, and a myriad of other imaginary ceilings. I thought I was great, but I was actually part of the problem.\nThere is more to life than code. At least for 99.99% of us. If you\u0026rsquo;re part of that 0.001%, for as long as you\u0026rsquo;re happy and healthy - that\u0026rsquo;s OK too. Don\u0026rsquo;t feel guilty if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the perfect green in GitHub activities. Don\u0026rsquo;t feel sad if you don\u0026rsquo;t wake up at 5:30 AM. Things change, your interests and priorities change - and that\u0026rsquo;s ok. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re really into programming today, 5 years later you decide that you want to be a bee farmer, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Live your own life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re currently struggling with your career or life right now, message me. I\u0026rsquo;m willing to listen.\n","date":"6 January 2021","permalink":"/blog/why-its-okay-to-be-an-ordinary-developer/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Someone once asked me, what does it take to become a prominent developer?","title":"Why it’s okay to be “an ordinary” developer"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s very tempting to click on \u0026ldquo;that next button\u0026rdquo; wether that is from YouTube, Netflix, Facebook videos or any endless buffet of consumption. You start watching a video about a topic you\u0026rsquo;re really interested in to and end up watching something weird after 3 hours. As I do more research in my personal journey of Digital Intentionalization, this is probably one of the most obvious ones. We let the platform play the next content.\n   The biggest problem that I see with these automated / personalised next buttons is that you settle simply accept someone\u0026rsquo;s recommendation without having a second thought about it. Again, you don\u0026rsquo;t have the full intention of consuming that content.\nIf you correlate this in the physical world, it\u0026rsquo;s like going to a buffet restaurant where you have the choice which food to eat, however after finishing the first meal, you just let someone put food in your table based from your previous meals - no need to stand nor choose from the menu. I for one like eating in buffets for the reason of tasting a variety of food (same thing with having unrestricted access to content), however, I know my limits. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t just eat a potato chips after eating a fried dumpling, I\u0026rsquo;d rather go for a roasted lamb.\nSo given you \u0026ldquo;shouldn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; press that next button, what should you do instead? I have 5 \u0026ldquo;tricks\u0026rdquo; to avoid getting in this rabbit hole.\n  Turn off auto-play settings. This is how to do it in Facebook Videos, Netflix, and YouTube. I know it\u0026rsquo;s a hassle that you have to go to certain loops just to configure this. Remember, they don\u0026rsquo;t want you to do it in the first place. All these media companies would want you to consume and consume and consume content. This setting is a onetime thing, or at least per device and per account.\n  Set limits. There are a lot of ways to do this right now. There are a lot of applications that offer this service. I would stick to the ones the operating system offers. In iOS and MacOS, there is a ScreenTime feature where you can set app-limits to these media services. There are also ways to do this in Windows 10 and Android. This will allow you to have a more conscious decision if you really need (or want) to watch that next video. I for one find it annoying that I get disrupted after playing a video after 30 minutes late at night, but it\u0026rsquo;s totally worth it. It\u0026rsquo;s a reminder it\u0026rsquo;s probably time to sleep. 🙂\n  Schedule something else. Often the reason we got into these situations (buffet-table-eating) is that we were bored at a specific point in time, or maybe we\u0026rsquo;re overwhelmed into a task and we want to distract ourselves a bit. We both know deep down that you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be watching all these videos, but you do it anyway. What I find useful to avoid these \u0026ldquo;down times\u0026rdquo; is to schedule something else. If you find yourself that you get bored at 2PM to 3PM watching endless videos, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time you schedule it for something more useful. This will force you to do something else that you\u0026rsquo;ve commit. Let\u0026rsquo;s say \u0026ldquo;meetings\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;exercise\u0026rdquo;, that FaceTime with a friend or distant relatives, or play 1 game of Dota 2.\n  Watch with someone. When something is done with a peer or a group, it takes a certain consent or agreement which content to consume. This is very effective as there is a conscious decision that whatever content there is, everyone (or at least most) should be comfortable with it. Obviously, not all content should be consumed as a peer or group, but I find it more fun when watching a TV series or movie. At least it\u0026rsquo;s not just me who thinks the series is trash or genuinely good. After watching, you also open some time to discuss the content.\n  Be conscious of your time. It took me quite a longer journey to realise that we don\u0026rsquo;t really have enough time in this world. We can\u0026rsquo;t watch the entire library of YouTube \u0026amp; Netflix in our lifespan (100 years) - and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t (unless it\u0026rsquo;s part of your job). One thing that I fancied lately is reading books. Since 2018, I read an average of 30+ books per year. If I am lucky to be alive by 80, then that means I can only read around 1,500 books from today until that time. How about spending that time to build \u0026ldquo;that startup\u0026rdquo;, the time to present at conferences, and so on? Once you get the grasp of this concept, your mental immune system will be more resistant on the junk contents you see.\n  There are other tricks that you can pull up that might work for you, but these are working for me right now. No self-help book or motivational video can help you with this if your mental power is weak, what you need are \u0026ldquo;tricks\u0026rdquo; to play with your emotions. These companies hire the best data scientists and experts in psychology so we get addicted to it. Who knows, maybe these platforms will come up with more aggressive strategy and algorithms for us to be sucked into the void. For now, start by not clicking on that next button.\n","date":"5 January 2021","permalink":"/blog/digital-intentionalization-dont-click-that-next-button/","section":"Blogs","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s very tempting to click on \u0026ldquo;that next button\u0026rdquo; wether that is from YouTube, Netflix, Facebook videos or any endless buffet of consumption.","title":"Digital Intentionalization: Don’t click that next button"},{"content":"During the holidays, I was contemplating on what skills should I invest time on for 2021. As someone who is working in the technology field, there are a lot of exciting things to double-down on: from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and a plethora of technology trends. As I reflected on how my 2020 went in terms of career and lifestyle, I noticed that there is an area I really need to work on - my digital life.\nI noticed that there are a lot of times I am in an \u0026ldquo;auto-pilot\u0026rdquo; mode from scrolling social media feeds, watching endless YouTube videos, and binging mediocre movies, and TV series. However, this concept falls not only within the \u0026ldquo;distractions\u0026rdquo; realm, but it also applies to the so-called \u0026ldquo;productive\u0026rdquo; realm. When working, I sometimes spend a lot of \u0026ldquo;midnight oils\u0026rdquo; just so I can finish things from the imaginary deadlines that I\u0026rsquo;ve set. A lot of times, when I thought I\u0026rsquo;m trying to solve a problem, I end up with a rabbit hole of other topics and discussions - I get sidetracked without me knowing it. This also applies to technical topics.\n   It\u0026rsquo;s silly and funny if you think about it if represented in a not-so-digital way. Imagine going in the car, you start the engine, but we set no destination; you\u0026rsquo;ll just drive across the block and see if something fun amuses you. However, as part of strolling along the streets, you also witness some not so good things or probably a lot of boring things - may be a ratio of 1:100; for every good thing you see around, it comes with 100 unpleasant sights.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve read a lot of self-help books around this topic, in particular a lot focuses on \u0026ldquo;Digital Minimalism\u0026rdquo; wherein they ask you to uninstall apps, unsubscribe to things, etc. In my opinion, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for everyone, at least it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for me. These digital technologies, platforms, and applications are part of my career and my lifestyle. One way or the other, I need App X and App Y. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t need them ALL the time.\nWhat I need is a \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; so I have the right intention when I\u0026rsquo;m about to use a device or application. I need to develop a mental model, framework, methodology so that even if I have over 10 devices, I can safeguard myself from the rabbit hole and infinity pool of contents. I think the right term for this is Digital Intentionality.\nWhat I want to accomplish by the end of the year are:\n  I will use my phone as a \u0026ldquo;reaction-based\u0026rdquo; device. Someone called me, let me call that person back. I need to show my ID, let me pull that app. I need to take a picture of that thing, pull it out. The need must come first, before I use it.\n  When I open a laptop, I know what I need to do. I need to use the keyboard to write on something. Book a hotel. Read a book while taking notes. Learn new skills or technologies. Do whatever tasks I\u0026rsquo;ve decided, then when I\u0026rsquo;m done, close the laptop.\n  When I need to work on a more compute-intensive tasks, I use my desktop or remote server. After the task, shut it down.\n  If I want to play some games, either use my Xbox or my desktop. I won\u0026rsquo;t be surfing the internet or fiddling with my phone while doing so. I\u0026rsquo;ll be focusing on the game.\n  When there is a good movie or TV Series to watch on, I\u0026rsquo;ll be watching it with full intention. If it sucks after the 10% mark, abandon it. Same applies with books and audiobooks.\n  In situations where I need to wait while being outside, I pull out my Kindle or a physical book that I have and do some light reading.\n  And a lot more that will help me let the devices serve me, not the other way around.\n   The modern struggle: Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising… Up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games, and addictive drugs. -Naval Ravikant\n These technologies are here to stay, you can\u0026rsquo;t just go rogue and live on the mountains.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not yet aware of Synology, they are the leading NAS (Network-attached storage) provider for home and work use-cases. You can use a NAS for pretty much anything such as backing up files, sharing files in a local network, streaming media files, or have your own \u0026ldquo;private cloud\u0026rdquo;.\nThroughout the years, the concept of NAS has developed and there is now a very thin line between doing things locally in your network and storage capabilities of cloud vendors.\nI am creating a Synology NAS series on highlighting the different capabilities of their NAS. In particular, the features that work within the Microsoft ecosystem such as Microsoft Azure, Azure Active Directory, and Microsoft 365, which is something I use on a day-to-day basis.\nIntroduction # Lately I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on a lot of live video analytics to analyse CCTV (surveillance) feeds and extract useful information around it. There are 3 major points around my customer\u0026rsquo;s business requirements and policy.\n The video analytics processing should happen in an \u0026ldquo;edge\u0026rdquo; environment. The stream should not send data constantly to the public cloud in real-time, where \u0026ldquo;the magic\u0026rdquo; is happening in the cloud. This whole environment including the \u0026ldquo;AI/ML\u0026rdquo; models should run through a local server. We archive CCTV feeds in the public cloud through a reliable and cost-effective public storage mechanism. There is no requirement for these videos to be accessible in real-time. The customer wants that network traffic should not clog or would require dedicated network connections for video processing and archiving. They leverage the same network infrastructure in their remote office locations.  Why Cloud Sync + Azure Storage? # In this specific business case, the customer already uses Synology for NAS and an active Azure subscription.\nOne thing you might think of is, why don\u0026rsquo;t I just use my personal OneDrive or Dropbox to do this? Well, the answer is that Enterprise customers usually have massive files. In particular, this customer has around 100+ cameras surveying 24/7. Using something of a personal subscription is not cost effective.\nThe video files are around 2 Terabytes per day and for archiving purposes only. Example is when there are incidents that require manual investigation.\nAzure Blob storage is the perfect fit for this as it has: hot, cool, and archive access tiers. Learn more here.\nCloud Sync can also schedule upload times to avoid disrupting the network during office hours.\nGetting Started # Setting up Cloud Sync is fairly easy and a straightforward process. To get started, go to your Synology NAS landing page. Then go to \u0026ldquo;Package Center\u0026rdquo; to search, install, and open Cloud Sync.   Choose a Cloud Provider # After opening Cloud Sync, it will prompt you to choose a cloud provider. Choose Azure storage.\nOptional: Create an Azure storage # If you don\u0026rsquo;t have an existing Azure Storage or wish to create a new one, then follow the steps below.\nIn the Azure portal, search for \u0026ldquo;Storage\u0026rdquo; and create a new instance.\nNote: You can customize other parameters here, such as Access Tier (Cool / Hot) and Performance (Standard / Premium).\nFinish the wizard and create the resource.\nOptional: Create a Blob Container # If you already have a blob container, skip to the next section. In your Azure storage, navigate to the Blob Service section of the main blade and click on Containers.\n   Create a container by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;+ Container\u0026rdquo; button. Assign a name and access to it.\nNote: For this specific exercise, the access level would not matter.\n   Retrieve the Storage Key # We need a storage key to establish a secure connection between Cloud Sync and the Azure storage.\nTo do this, go to the Azure Portal and navigate to the Azure storage that you want Cloud Sync to point to.\nIn the Settings section of the main blade of the storage account, go to \u0026ldquo;Access Keys\u0026rdquo;.\nCopy the value of either key1 or key2. Make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t share these keys to other people who don\u0026rsquo;t need it, nor save it to a location that others can easily access like a text file.\nCloud Sync - establish connection # Go back to the Cloud Sync wizard and fill in the details below:\n Service endpoint: Azure Global (or China) Storage account: name of the Azure storage without prefixes and suffixes. Note that all storage account names are unique. Access key: Paste in the key mentioned above. Blob container name: The Blob container where you want to upload the files.  Click on Next.\nChoose the folder(s) you want to Sync # In the task setting, Select which folder(s) you want to sync. I recommend that you merge the files in a folder specific for archiving.\nChoose Sync Direction # You have the option to set the sync direction of your files. In most cases it is ideal to set it to Bidirectional, so that when a system fails, you still have other options to back-up and recover files.\nSet schedule settings # This is an outstanding feature of Cloud Sync. With this customer, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to upload the Terabytes of data during office hours. We only set it during off hours and weekends.\nSet the time of days you want syncing to run and suspended.\nOptional: Encrypt Data # There is an optional setting to encrypt data. This will allow the files to be encrypted in transit and when in storage. The downside of doing this approach is that only Cloud Sync can recognize the data that were uploaded.\nComplete the Wizard # Click on Next and finish the wizard. A pop-up should appear, confirming a successful setup.\nOnce the connection to the Azure storage is established, you will see the notifications saying files are being synced.\nConclusion # To my interest, I\u0026rsquo;ve also adapted this pattern with my personal/home surveillance system.\nOne thing I would say is that - it just works - which is good. I think it\u0026rsquo;s seldom to see managed services or platform these days where the burden of over configuration is in the hands of the customer.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been running this setup for a few weeks now and I am very delighted with the results. The setup is very easy that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require deep technical skills in file storage. I remember the days when doing this would require complex scripts to sync between network files and centralized servers. Those days are now a thing of a past.\n","date":"28 September 2020","permalink":"/blog/synology-nas-series-cloud-sync-with-azure-storage/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Foreword # Synology reached out to me to give their new DiskStation DS920+ a review.","title":"Synology NAS Series – Cloud Sync with Azure Storage"},{"content":"Wow! It’s been 5 years since my first Microsoft MVP award. If you don’t know what the Microsoft MVP program is, check this site. Throughout the years, I have transitioned from various categories and technology award. In particular, Windows Development (Windows 8/8.1/10/RT and XAML), to Developer Technologies (C#, .NET, Xamarin), to Azure with focus on Blockchain, PAAS (Platform as a Service), and Integrations.\nIn those years, I’ve seen Microsoft and the MVP program changed a lot (for the better). Products have changed, a lot of new services emerged, new categories introduced, and a big push on Cloud (Azure and Microsoft 365). Open source also became a norm, and a lot of complex service offerings were simplified and subsidised into a managed service.\nThe journey began when I was back in Philippines and got exposed to the Microsoft development communities. These different thought leaders inspired me, and ought I’ll follow the same path. Since then, I have been to different cities and countries - and it’s astonishing to see how people use technology (mostly related to Microsoft) to solve problems. Being part of the community brought so much for me, in particular the people I have met. I learned a lot from them (still do). That also gave me motivation to present to audiences and mentor different teams and individuals. I just like it when I share my knowledge and experience - and people find it useful.\n   The program helped a lot in my career. It complements to what I do on a day-to-day basis. I use various Microsoft and related technologies to create valued products and services to organizations and individuals. It gave me a lot of networking and sales opportunities (within and outside of Microsoft) that I may have not materialized without the people I’ve met in the community. I also get to see products, services, and features early on and make strategic decisions on where to invest my learning capacity for the future. It’s nice to be part of this journey, even if you’re not working for the company.\nBeing in this program provides me a pathway for continuous learning and continuous sharing. I’ve had opportunities to present at various user-groups, conferences (even organise some), write a book, do webinars, product reviews, and so much more. I have mentored and befriended some of the best technologist I’ve met (some are now MVPs too) and I will continue to share my passion to the next person I’ll meet. The award is meaningless if it’s not for the community and people you interact with. For me, this is a commitment to say that I’m always here when someone needs a helping hand or two in their technology problems.\nWhere do I go from this? My career was born on the cloud. There’s just so much to learn, work on, collaborate, and share to the community. I was lucky that I’ve got to work on these different technologies and see them grow. Some of my focus for the next year ahead includes: Cloud Native (AKS and Terraform in particular), AI workloads on Cloud, and Edge computing.\nSince it\u0026rsquo;s a new normal now to present at webinars and virtual events, I\u0026rsquo;ll be taking part more into that space. I\u0026rsquo;m also co-authoring a new \u0026ldquo;hands-on\u0026rdquo; book. A podcast is also on the way. Last, I will do my best to write more technical blogs (coming soon).\n","date":"9 September 2020","permalink":"/blog/5-years-of-being-a-microsoft-mvp/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Wow!

There are many reasons I stopped writing. I find different excuses for not doing it. Lazy. Busy. Afraid that contents I write may not be good enough. I feel my English is not good enough. So much more. No one will read it, why write?\n   But then the more I think about it, the more I realised that I spend a lot of time in my day writing. Whether that\u0026rsquo;s writing an email, chats, creating documentations, or even programming. The fundamental problem I have is that I\u0026rsquo;m not as confident in writing as I am in public speaking. You can ask me to present to hundreds or thousands of audience, but writing for people I don\u0026rsquo;t know or may not exist - there\u0026rsquo;s just too much pressure on it. I need to work on this fear.\nI have always wanted to share my thoughts about things. There are many things I want to say. There are many things to write about: Reaction to this current pandemic; How fatherhood is treating me; The things I like; The things I hate; Things that I learn outside of work (and technology); Write a poem or letter.\nFor the past years, I or for the most of us, we have been living in a digital consumerism era. We just keep consuming content, and we don’t really do anything about it. We don’t discuss it; we don’t talk about it. We just watch or read it - full stop.\nI need a space on the internet that I can say is mine. No ads. No promotions. No walled garden platform. I own this place: the domain, the content, the infrastructure that runs it. I have the absolute freedom to put whatever I want or think. I want to be in control of my digital life, the content I consume, the content I share, and the consequences of doing so.\nAll the tools needed in writing and sharing content are there. You\u0026rsquo;ll just have to start somewhere. There is an art and beauty in creating authentic content - just like any other industry or discipline. All we just need is to spend time and effort on it.\nOne thing I’ve learned through the books I’ve read in the past years, time is always the most valuable asset. Not money or career success, but time. Having the notion you have control of your time and have the freedom on where to spend it. I want to spend a lot of time writing and I am doing it now.\n","date":"26 August 2020","permalink":"/blog/writing-again/","section":"Blogs","summary":"I have been meaning to write a blog post for an awfully long time, but it has blocked me for so many reasons.","title":"I’m going to start writing again!"},{"content":"Page is under construction.

I wore many hats from being a developer, tester, data engineer, IT operations, solutions architect, project manager, technical pre-sales, trainer, and everything else in between. I had some very successful outcomes and some that also failed or did not materialised. However, one thing is certain – learning is process and the journey; there is no end.\nI currently own a boutique software consulting company, Datachain Consulting, which aims to democratise Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Internet of Things technologies as a differentiator for businesses. I choose my clients carefully and I decided to stay lean \u0026amp; small. On the side, I am actively exploring ideas that can be turned into products or services as a longer term investment.\nI am a Microsoft MVP and a continuous contributor to the community. It’s in my DNA to help others those who are struggling in tech, as I myself walked (and still am) to those same shoes. I’ve decided to become more active in writing and creating contents. I present at conferences, user groups, and various events when I can.\nLately, I’m into productivity and the whole building your second brain hype. I am learning a lot of techniques and frameworks to keep myself motivated and productive.
