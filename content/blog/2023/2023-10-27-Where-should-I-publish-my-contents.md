I've always been passionate about creating and delivering content. It's a thrilling process, taking an idea and shaping it into something tangible, something that can enlighten, entertain or inspire others. But in today's fast-paced, digital-first world, it can be a struggle to keep up. The modern content landscape is like a high-speed train, and I'm often left wondering whether I should jump on board or stay true to my slower, more deliberate pace.

On [Medium](https://medium.com/@mjtpena), I'm planning to share my knowledge about Data Engineering. These won't be your run-of-the-mill articles; they will be handcrafted pieces, each one reflecting my insights and understanding of the subject.

While juggling article writing, I'm also immersed in a more extensive project: writing a book (watch out on this space). It's a challenging process, but it's gratifying in a way that's hard to describe. I'm also collaborating on shorter pieces with [Serverless Notes](https://www.serverlessnotes.com/docs/metrics-monitoring-building-dashboards-synapse-pipeline), adding another layer to my content creation journey.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljohnpena/) is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on Azure and [Playtime Solutions](https://www.playtimesolutions.com.au/). It's a platform that suits my personality and interests, and my comfort zone within my professional network.

I'm also planning to contribute more to [dev.to](https://dev.to/mjtpena), a platform that caters to developers and programming enthusiasts. Here, I'll focus on practical "How to" guides and developer-specific topics.

Data on Cloud is the area of focus I'm actively exploring such as diving into data stores and analytics. While AI and Machine Learning are hot topics, I'm not quite ready to delve into them yet in depth. The cloud (Azure) in general is something I've delved with for more than a decade and I want to do more talks and conference speaking in this space.

I'm also looking to get more involved in the [Tech Community forums of Microsoft](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/309346#profile), providing feedback and service announcements, and helping others navigate the tech landscape of the ecosystem.

[This blog](https://michaeljohnpena.com) is my personal space, a place for me to share my thoughts and experiences, and not just about technology.

When it comes to capturing personal moments, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mjtpena) is my platform of choice. It's where I'll share snapshots of my life with my family.

[Threads](https://www.threads.net) will be my outlet for discussing health-related topics, both mental and physical. It's an area I feel strongly about and one that I think deserves more attention.

I am struggling to find my voice and space in the following spaces. The whole [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mjtpena) and streaming, unsure of how to make my mark. Podcasting and newsletters are also areas I'm exploring, but finding the right approach is a challenge.

There are also platforms I'm consciously avoiding for now, including Twitter and Mastodon, Stack Overflow, Quora, and other Q/A forums, as well as TikTok and Reels.

In this ever-evolving landscape of content creation, staying authentic is a challenge. I'm not interested in trend-jacking or pumping out AI-generated content. My aim is to create content that reflects my knowledge, my experiences, and my personality. It's a learning curve, but one I'm willing to navigate. Here's to the journey ahead!
