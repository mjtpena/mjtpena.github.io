# 🏫 Therapies and Schools

## Therapies

### 🎙 Speech Therapy

- We’ve recorded an all time high in terms of Andriel’s use of main communication words: More, Help, and Yes. They are at a functional state at this point, that the words that he speaks mean the actual message. We will continue working on this to make sure that we get that level of consistency. We will also implement “1 up” with these words to encourage Andriel to go beyond the word. Example: “More banana”, “More drink”, “More egg”
- Andriel’s listening and receptive skills have dramatically improved as well, specially on an outdoor setting. Things like “Press Up” on elevator gets 100% accuracy and he won’t have to button smash things. He also recognises people’s distinct voices, as evident of him looking at his dad whenever he’s being called whilst outdoor.
- Andriel continues to expand his vocabulary as well as continues to attempt to say the words based from his intent. In a fruit basket, it’s very distinct that he would request for: “Apples”, “Oranges”, and “Banana”.

### 🧠 Psychologist / Behaviour Therapy

- We had our last session with Ben from Cross Care.
- Throughout the months, Andriel have learned the basic emotions and can determine on pictures people who are “Sad”, “Happy”, and “Angry.”
- Andriel (and the parents) is equipped with tools to handle anger management such as doing the “Elephant sound” to perform simple breathing exercises. As part of this, Andriel also tends to have less frustration as he was able to communicate better what he wants and needs.
- We also decided to opt out from a Psychology therapy for the time being.

### 🚴‍♀️ Occupational Therapy

- Andriel has adjusted with the new schedule and OT.
- Andriel shows a lot of interests in activities that involve movement. Priya builds up on top of this by adding extra steps or complexity on it. Such as instead of just swinging, we also teach Andriel to kick. Andriel shows to learn those skills quite fast when he’s very engaged.
- Andriel does a lot of “sit in” activities such as scissors cutting, drawing, and play dough activities. This is to prepare Andriel in a school environment.

## Pre-schools

### 🌈 SDN Beranga (Autism Specific)

- The educators continue with the implementing the Individual Education Plan (IEP). As part of the plan and alignment with the speech therapist, the educators will encourage Andriel with verbal communication and the visual communication devices (cards and iPad) becomes secondary.
- Andriel participates in variety of activities and 1-on-1s with Yashu (key educator).
- Andriel loves playing outside, and his particular favourite is the monkey bars.

### 🦋 Papilio Ingleburn (Mainstream)

- Andriel participates on indoor plays. He particularly likes the wooden blocks. This develops his creativity on what he can build from his imagination.
- He also enjoys playing outside.

## 🪜 Primary Schools

- We’ve met up with one of the catholic schools in Sydney Southwest and they will have to circle back to us regarding what support they can do for Andriel. They might also include Sydney Catholic Schools (Main Office) in the discussion.
- We’re still waiting for his Paediatrician’s up to date diagnosis report to be sent to Aspect Macarthur as part of enrolment prerequisites.
- We’re still waiting for Austral Public school if any further actions are required.

# 🏡Home and Family Activities

## Home Updates

**Toileting**. Andriel is very consistent with toilets whether at home, schools, or outdoor settings. He doesn’t wear nappies anymore, even at sleep! He goes to the toilet every morning and frequently from then. On occasions that he feels like going to the toilet, he will do it by himself at home. However, he is still working his way on the “Vacuum sound” of hand dryers of public toilets as this is something that makes him uncomfortable.

**Dentist**. Andriel is re-scheduled next month for his dental surgery. He had a mild flu and cough on the day of his scheduled operation and we were advised to re-schedule next month instead.

**Home Therapies**. At home, we are using various materials as a form of activity for Andriel to learn new skills and knowledge. We use a variety of iPad learning applications, interactive songs, activity book (provided by Papilio Ingleburn), and physical toys. We observed that Andriel continues to participate on activities given the right rhythm of breaks, “accompany toy”, activities he liked vs activities he dislikes.

**Outdoor observations**. Andriel will still hold his dad or mum’s hands whenever he goes out. He has a very good stamina in terms of how far he can walk whenever he’s outside. Whenever he goes for a run, he would actually look at you and acknowledge your presence (asking you to chase him). He is aware of spatial surroundings and doesn’t have problems navigating crowded places, slopes, and narrow pathways.

**Family Gathering**. Andriel is OK with having a large group of people around him. For the first time, he was also able to “play” with his cousin “Milly” in a playground. Andriel shows eye contact to acknowledge that he’s playing “with someone” and also follows Milly’s lead.
