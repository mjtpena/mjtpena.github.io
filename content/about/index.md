Hello there 👋 Welcome to my little space of the internet that I can call mine.

For the past 10 years, I’ve spent my career dealing with software and the cloud. I wore many hats from being a developer, tester, data engineer, IT operations, solutions architect, project manager, technical pre-sales, trainer, and everything else in between. I had some very successful outcomes and some that also failed or did not materialised. However, one thing is certain &#8211; learning is process and the journey; there is no end.

I currently own a boutique software consulting company, [Datachain Consulting](https://datachain.consulting), which aims to democratise Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Internet of Things technologies as a differentiator for businesses. I choose my clients carefully and I decided to stay lean & small. On the side, I am actively exploring ideas that can be turned into products or services as a longer term investment.

I am a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001648?fullName=Michael%20John%20Timpoc%20Peña) and a continuous contributor to the community. It’s in my DNA to help others those who are struggling in tech, as I myself walked (and still am) to those same shoes. I’ve decided to become more active in writing and creating contents. I present at conferences, user groups, and various events when I can.

Lately, I’m into productivity and the whole building your second brain hype. I am learning a lot of techniques and frameworks to keep myself motivated and productive. On my free time, I read books and enjoy various cardio activities such as running & cycling.
