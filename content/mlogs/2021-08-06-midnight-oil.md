There are some legitimate excuse in my opinion to burn the midnight oil - aka work late at night. I do this so that I don't have to work over the weekends, and I can spend a lot of quality time with my family. This also allows me to work on a task that I know I can finish, or at least hit a milestone of,  instead of procrastinating it for the next day or week (something I've done a lot in the past). I only do it on Tuesdays and Thursdays these days.

Obviously, it's not something I'll do everyday. At least that's what I'm thinking of right now. Sometimes you're just in the flow, with no distractions, and free with your thoughts to execute the creative tasks at hand such as writing, coding, or any form of knowledge work. It's important that you're doing it because you really want to do it, not because you're under a lot of pressure from someone else. This is really about your exercise to "just do it", without thinking of any barriers.
