Weekends are very important to me now. Back then, I treat it as a way to do more work while others are busy with their personal lives. That was so wrong in so many levels. For one, you need the actual rest so that you'll have the energy and motivation for the week ahead. Another thing is that, it's also the time to do things that you don't normally do during work time. This includes doing side projects, exploring new hobbies, and making memories with your family and friends. At the end of the week, it's really what matters that count, not the amount of $$$ that you have.
