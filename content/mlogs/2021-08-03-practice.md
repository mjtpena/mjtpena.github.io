Practice makes perfect. Maybe not "perfect" for everyone, but close to the objective or your goal. It takes a lot of repetition to truly master a craft or a profession, you need to spend a lot of those hours in order to learn what works and what doesn't work. For most of the time, practicing is a mental game of repetition in order to really "nail it." You can't just be an expert to a specific topic overnight. You can have an opinion about it, but not an expert. It's those repeated failures and struggles that will emerge you as an expert to that topic or practice.
