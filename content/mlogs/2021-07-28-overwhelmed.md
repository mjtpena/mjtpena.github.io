Overwhelmed. I think that's a state when you have a lot of things in your mind and you're fighting an internal battle on how to deal with your problems. Sometimes the answers are not very clear and you don't have the answers right away. To overcome this state, you have to stop what you're doing and try to look from a far. You have to re-organize your thoughts on what's really important and what's urgent. In the grand scheme of things, all the items in your head are just flow of information that changes state and needs further processing. So stop. Re-think. Attack again.
