Focus is very important. This is what sets a task to be done in months or days into hours and minutes. Having focus means having the dexterity to know where to shoot your arrow. For me to be in focus, I need to be in flow. I was a victim of being a "hardworker" in the past, where I burn the midnight oil to non-valuable things. 

I need to make sure I setup my mindset and environment to respect my thought processing. In time, it's getting easier for me to achieve FLOW because of exercise and meditation. I don't force myself if I can't do it anymore. Take some rest if needed. All of those thoughts are just cars passing by. Let them pass.
