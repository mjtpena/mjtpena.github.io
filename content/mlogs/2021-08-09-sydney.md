Sydney is home for me. When I first came here on 2011, I already knew that this place is home and this is where I want to grow a family. There are so many things I like about Sydney: having both my sisters here and extended family, from food and people diversity, a lot of friends I met along the way. It brought me a lot of opportunity, from being a coder, consultant, and entrepreneur; I thrived in this place. The culture fits me right. The wine, steak, beach, BBQ; they all speak to me. 

Although there are a lot of things I miss from the Philippines, I know this is the place for me right now. I love the work and environment that I have, it is more than a comfort zone. I am very thankful that I'm here right now. I am contributing to this economy and society as much as I can.
