Winter, spring, summer, or fall - I love bits and pieces of them. I love that on winter I can have a cool environment to sleep on. I hate winter, because it gets dark too early! I love spring because of the beautiful plants and flowers around, but I also hate it because of hay fever. I love summer because it's the best time to go to the beach and you have a lot of day time to spend outside business hours. I hate it when it's extremely hot and it causes bushfires! I love fall because when it's rainy, I get to concentrate with my work. For obvious reasons of rain, I don't want to see dried leaves that much (it looks sad). You see, you can't have everything. I tend to focus more on the advantages of each seasons, rather than complaining all the time.
