I'm particularly liking the Markdown format in creating notes. Thanks to [[RoamResearch]] and [[Hugo]] (with the whole JAMstack craze), I am being sucked in this cult. I am actually realizing the benefits as I have more structure on my thoughts and flow of information. I follow a format that would work to most systems these days, and it's easy to convert and transpose anywhere. 

I am still learning some of the advanced capabilities of Markdown. But so far the basic indenting, header, attaching of images are more than enough to get the hook of it. In the future, I would probably be looking at advanced formatting and positioning of texts / images. Also, I am also king [[Marp]] as a tool to convert Markdowns to PDF or PPT.
