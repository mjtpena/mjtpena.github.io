Achieving "success" is actually very simple, but the process is often hard. For example, you want to be an author, all you have to do is to keep on writing - over and over, day in and out. You won't be an author "overnight" per-se, it's those thousands and millions of words that come out of your mind and the hundreds of revisions that will make you an author.

The same applies to being an entrepreneur, all you have to do is to keep on exploring business opportunities. Keep on selling solutions to people's problem. It's about the constant market research, the cold-calling, networking events, and so on. You don't become a successful entrepreneur just by "being lucky" overnight. It's often a mixture of "relative effort", resources, and luck. 

Another example is doing marathons. To be good at running, cycling, swimming, and other cardio activities - you just have to keep training repeatedly. Again, simple but hard.
