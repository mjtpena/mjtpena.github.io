It's the political season again in the Philippines and my whole network back there are all over places expressing their opinions and political views. At this point, I don't really have much to say about it, and I don't have the right mindset and priorities to be in it. I have other set of problems and deliverables to deal with. I have business ventures to run, and ideas that needs to be polished, tested, and executed.

As part of this, I would like to spend less time in the next couple of weeks on Social Media as a consumer. I'd be solely using my social accounts as a content creator and posting using marketing tools. As usual, the problem that I have with social media is that when I don't interact with it, then it just becomes a COG machine that gets funneled in my head without me really getting much out of it.
