Terminals, shells, and CLIs are some of the recent things that I keep tinkering about. I like to make them colourful, using a lot of plugins to automate my typings, and all the goodness of just executing commands.

Back then, I was a GUI (Graphical User Interface) person, but I just found that for some advanced scenarios; I have to really use the command line to execute advanced commands or scripts. I found the experience hard at first, but after a while, it has been a friendly and smooth ride.

I would still use a mix of GUI and CLI for different workflows. I won’t be a purist on one option, as I know that there are advantages to choose one from the other. However, I’m pretty sure that even when the technology progresses in a decade, we will still use a form factor of a terminal.
