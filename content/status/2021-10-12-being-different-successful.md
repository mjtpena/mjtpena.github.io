In order to be successful, you have to do things differently from others. The key words are "do" and "different"; and both of them needs to be present. It's not enough to just "be different" - like you're different from others because of your background, personality, or skills. It's about applying actions on those different ideas. It's about trying to think outside the box, but also working on testing if the idea is viable. 

Doing things different will make your odds higher than not doing it nor doing it just like everyone else. In this ever connected world of social media, internet, and mobile phones. In order to thrive, you have to create content that are uniquely different - something that establishes your brand. Success is inevitable once you put on the effort and constant iterations on it.

Do something different today, and you might propel yourself for future success!
