Breakfast as they say is the most important meal of the day. I'm not really sure if that applies to me. I tend not to eat on breakfasts or just eat something small portioned instead. I tend to be more productive if I don't feel bloated or dizzy after a very heavy meal. The problem that I have is that I have the impulse to overeat or stress eat, which is something I have to work on separately. This is the reason why I want to start with not eating so much.

I'm now going back to the routine of just eating one meal a day, and the rest are just fluids or liquids. I just drink a cup of coffee or a shake. I need to lose weight not just because of general aesthetics purposes, but as a long-lived lifestyle. I of all people inherited all the bad genes from my mom and dad in terms of health diseases. I want to live long enough that it's a balance of I've eaten things that I want but on moderation, and the rest are spent on good experiences.
