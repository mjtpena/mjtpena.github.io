Ideas are cheap. As a noun, it means nothing but a reference to something that could be great. It's just an abstract concept that doesn't have any tangible way for either you or others to experience.

In order for ideas to mean something, it needs to transition from a noun to a verb (action) because by only putting the work and process on to it, that's when value comes in. Only then, the idea becomes a product, a service, an outcome - and eventually turn in to business, profit, and purpose. 

Ideas that stay as noun, in time will be regrets. "I had that idea long ago..." "I thought about that..." "If only I did that..."
If you are really wedded to your idea, go do something about it. If not, move on...
