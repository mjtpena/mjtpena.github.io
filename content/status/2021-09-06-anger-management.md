I would say that one of the best things that change in my character is how I can remain calm despite of stress and general disappointments in life. I realized it is so tiring to be angry with something if you know that it’s not really a battle worth fighting. I realized that you only have limited time in this world, and I don’t want to be live and be remembered as someone who is angry all the time. 

On a day-to-day basis, I experience a lot of problems at work, my relationship, and general happenings as part of the pandemic. I want to stay calm when I can. When times get tough and rage is feeling up my nerves, I go to a safe place or channel (such as writing) to put on those negative emotions. I think, therefore, exercises and meditation would really help a lot with these kinds of things. I don’t want to be very rushed with decisions. Keep calm, think through it, then execute once you’re in a better thought process.
