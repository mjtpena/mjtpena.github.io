I like waking up early in the morning when everything is still quiet and calm. The sunrise gives me a feeling of warmth that radiates energy for the day ahead. This is a ceremony that it's really a new day ahead.

I'm now re-developing a habit of waking up early again (sometime between 5:00 to 7:00 AM). Whenever I set myself for a successful morning, I know that I'll stick to the routine all throughout the day. It's about consistency and making things "easy". 

If executed well, it's also the best time to learn something new or do challenging "deep work tasks". The reason why I want to work on this routine again, is because comes 9:00 AM onwards, it's pure chaos of calls and unexpected things again (a separate mental model to apply). I want to make sure that I own the day ahead and be in control!
