I’ve had a love and hate relationship with social media platforms in the past decade. Even until today, I haven’t really had a solid stance about these. I am aware of the dangers of these platforms when used excessively and inappropriately. I’ve tried shutting down my social media accounts from time to time. I keep creating new ones too. Right now, my Instagram is deactivated. I probably spend around 4 to 5 hours a week on these platforms (better that before).

What changed this past year, though, is my aspiration to become a content producer instead. I want to keep a taking part in various activities and share my knowledge and various expertise. As much as possible, I don’t want to just be watching in the sidelines - I want to blend in. I want to keep on writing. I am now looking at creating various contents, such as participating in open source projects, creating YouTube videos, and so on. 

I think what we need are more producers who have the skin in their game. We want people who will put on what they know and what they’re working on to make sure that you build authenticity and credibility. A lot of these so-called influencers are so overrated and don’t really bring a lot of value, at least not for me. What we need are more people who will bend the rules of the game. People who want to genuinely make a positive impact. I am part of that movement. Making the world a better place, one keystroke at a time.
