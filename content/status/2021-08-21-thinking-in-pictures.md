My brain works better when I think in pictures. This is probably why I thrive as a software engineer and architect. I can easily visualize data flows and business requirements; then translate them into something technical that we can implement. I have not really undergone any serious tests or evaluation, but I’m really at my best when I can visualize things.

That’s probably why I enjoy seeing architecture diagrams and love doing them too! I become so passionate about “well-architected” software and something that is well thought of. This does not apply to my work though, but all throughout various aspects of my life, like looking at my calendar, looking at my desk, arrangements for my furniture, reading data, and so forth.

Picture indeed says a thousand words. I’m pretty sure I’m not alone in this line of thought. There are others who are in the same space and approach as I do. I enjoy doing puzzles, and solving problems that are relevant and valuable. Think in pictures, you see the world through a clearer lens.
