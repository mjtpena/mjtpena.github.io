The ideal job exists. It's not perfect, but ideal. It's when you're both learning and earning, and at the same time pursuing an interest. You should be learning, as the world changes, you're also adopting to the global trends. In a fulfilling career, making money is often a bonus or a vehicle to keep going. Often the ideal jobs are when you're enjoying the process and the daily grind of it, rather than just working on it for renumeration purposes. An ideal job is when you've set up a goal today and few years later you're just astonished on how far you've come and how much experience you gathered.
