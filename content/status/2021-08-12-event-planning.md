Planning an event is both fun and frustrating at the same time. It's fun because you get to do something that is servicing for others (such as a community or group of people). There are so many thing that you can learn in the process from understanding different people's perspectives and likeness, to the variety of topics, to understanding the current industry trends, and the list goes on. It is sometimes frustrating because there are just too many unknowns before, during, and after the events. The ability to adapt and execute is key for a successful event planning. Of course no event will ever be "super perfect", but it's the overall outcome that matters. I think overall, it's about the value of what you'll gain in experience should justify the effort that you are going to exert for it. And of course, it's not just about you you you. It's about them them them.
