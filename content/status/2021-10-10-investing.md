Investing is better than saving. But saving is way better than spending so much. Investing is a means of earning more money by using your existing money as an instrument. Again, money begets money.

My general rule in life is that whatever it takes, yield at least 6% more each year. This is just a guidance that you should earn at least 6% more to beat the inflation. Your money, if just sitting on the bank, will depreciate.

I would consider that I'm lucky (not really that smart) because of some investments that I yielded into a lot for the past years. I would live as frugal as I can and earn as much as possible.
