Hybrid cloud is the trend right now I see in a lot of companies and enterprises. The term hybrid has grown too in the last couple of years. It just showed connectivity between an on-premises data center to public clouds like AWS and Azure. This time, hybrid now also means multi-cloud strategy and edge computing. It’s about borderless connectivity across different topologies or deployment models happening around. 

Edge computing is an interest to me, because there are a lot of operations that would make sense in an isolated environment. Video analytics and computer vision are some of the prime examples of using edge technologies. Companies shouldn’t send all the streaming data to the public in order to extract analytics from it. We want a faster but cost efficient model in performing these complex operations. It’s not ideal to set up a whole data center in an isolated area. 

There are so many exciting improvements happening in both Hybrid Cloud, IoT, and AI. These are the ones that are slowly changing the way we approach computing and businesses. We are really embracing a more decentralized infrastructure, one way or the other, for all your “compute” requirements. I want to see more and more use cases of IoT and AI on edge in the future.
