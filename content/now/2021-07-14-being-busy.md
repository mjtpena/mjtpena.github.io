Being busy does not always equate to being productive. You can just be in a state of busy because you think you're doing something important. Sometimes, what you need is not "to be busy", but "to be focused" on a task at hand. Time management is always the key to ensure that you get the right things done in your glorified to do list. Next time, instead of saying "I'm busy", say something like "I'll be working on..." or "I have an urgent thing to finish, I'll be right back to you." We have a very limited amount of time in this world, so make sure you make it count.
