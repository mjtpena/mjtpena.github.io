Love is effortful and attentive. It's a good disturbance in our lives. It is a continuous process that we develop on a daily basis. It's about giving the best quality time despite having limited free time because of all the work and ventures that you're doing. It's about the constant reminder of what really matters. 

You don't just say you love someone (or something) without putting the attention and effort on making it better. It's more around how you can cultivate those seeds in to something meaningful not just for yourself. Love is tiring and exhausting, but it's a good kind of restlessness. It means that you're actively working on it, you keep pouring in your effort and attention to it. 

Love matters.
