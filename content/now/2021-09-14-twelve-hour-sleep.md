12 hours of sleep. Wow, it’s been a while since I had that. I can’t really remember when was the last time that happened. It felt so good to be that energized and ready to become productive after a long, painful night of flu. I was alone in a comfortable bed mattress, it’s so quiet, and the weather & temperature was just right. It’s seldom that this happens. No phone calls, no disturbances, no notifications, no nothing. That is indeed what makes me rich. I guess sleep is now the good measurement of how wealthy you really are.

The feeling was way better than having to watch late night movies or binge watching/playing something. Sleep is one of the best reward in this world. A good quality sleep lets you feel better all throughout. I should probably take more long hour of sleep once in a while.
