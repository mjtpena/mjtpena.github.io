I believe vaccines will save many people. I believe in the science behind it. Back in high school, it fascinated me about how vaccines are actually formed. It gave me some conviction that science is absolute and hard solid facts - not an opinion on your head. It is defined by certain rules, theories, and peer-reviewed by multiple smart people.

However, I don’t think it’s necessary for it to be a state or country mandate. It should still up to the individual to decide whether he/she wants to get vaccinated. This becomes complex when we have to mix politics, economics, and science all together. They have different principles and agenda in mind. However, I believe they are all aligned (and should) around the general welfare and safety of the citizens.

I wonder when this pandemic will really end. Until then, I’ll make sure people around me are vaccinated, consistently wearing masks, and still following social distancing. It still uncertain times for us. It’s the right balance of making sense of this life while being trapped in a cage or bubble.
