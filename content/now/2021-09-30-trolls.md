Trolls are people on the internet who have the intention of getting in to your nerves by distracting you with bashful or hurtful comments. They are masked with a fake account and doesn't really show who they are and how they are related to you. Some of them are just completely random, some of them are targeted from your peers and network.

The moment you entertain them, then they become successful on what they intended to do. So the best course of action is to just ignore them. I haven't experienced that much trolling in my life, as I am not really in the mood for a fight and would be better of spending that time to something else. I don't tolerate them. I don't even think about them late at night.

For as long as you and your family is safe, then you don't really have to worry about it that much. Some people are just bored and miserable in their lives, and got nothing better to do. At the end of the day, it's a question of who really suffers and how. For as long as you don't get affected mentally and you still get ahead of your day, then all should be fine. You only have limited amount of time and energy in this world, so better spend them somewhere that makes more impact and sense - things that you really care about.
