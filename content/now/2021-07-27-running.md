Running is an activity that I particularly like. It doesn't have a lot of rules, and it's a sport or game that is natural to all of us humans. It's something you can do as a group or alone, again not much rules. I find running "meditative" as this allows me to wrap around my head in terms of flow of thoughts and how to solve or approach a specific problem at hand. I'm not an athlete in terms of running or nothing competitive at this point. I just want to do it for the obvious health benefits and the state of flow it gives me. I recommend it to those who work as a creative thinker.
