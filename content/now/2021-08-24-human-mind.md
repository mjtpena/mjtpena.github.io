The human mind and body are funny and amazing at the same time. We do a lot of things that make little sense on a high level or just by looking at it literally. One example I keep thinking about is the concept of “resting” such as taking sleeps, naps, or doing recreational activities. We’re unique as species because we have our own concept of “motivation” and rationale to answer “why you want to do it”. This goes to my question of why do I like to do other “stressful” activities such as running, or doing side projects, or doing long drives to have a break from my “main gig”. 

I think it’s very important to understand who you are and what motivates you because this will help you understand your limits and potentials. Once you know more about yourself, then you would have a reason “why you are doing it”. For me, I really like doing things that are related to technology, hence instead of pouring all 120 hours of my life per week on my main work, I make sure I evenly distribute my attention and energy for my family, work, side projects, hobbies, and relaxation. This works for me. Maybe it won’t work for you, but our bodies and minds are so amazing!
