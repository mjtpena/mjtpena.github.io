I don’t really struggle to wake up early. Today I woke up at around 04:00 AM and it wasn’t a challenge at all. I am doing it because I find my writing and creative thinking to be early in the morning. 

I am a mix of morning person and a night owl. I could spend the entire night being in the zone programming and solving problems, but I can also wake up early to begin my writing flow or do some “deep work.” However, if I need to finish something and I committed to doing it, then I’ll do it regardless what time of the day it is.

I think what’s important is you actively explore and experiment what works best for you. Others would be equally productive by staying up late because of the calmness of the environment. It’s not about what time do you wake up. It’s about having a system that works for you.
