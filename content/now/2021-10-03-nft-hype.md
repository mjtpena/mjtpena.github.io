There is so much happening in the NFT space right now, it's so interesting, fascinating, and intimidating at the same time. While most of my circles are still stuck in to the enterprise applications and the more traditional web & mobile applications, a select people are changing the world by storm. There is a little fear of missing out on my end, but for me that's really adding some spice to this universe. It's so exciting.

At this point, I have at least 3 involvements in this game. Instead of just watching or investing on the side, I am building things that might turn to actual products and profit. I am happy to really pour in my time to this. I can't get distracted right now with other naysayers and things. I think it's time to really focus up my game on this. Less time on social media as a consumer, but more time as a producer and builder.
