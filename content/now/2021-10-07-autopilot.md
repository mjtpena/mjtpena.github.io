Never go to autopilot. This is a state when you're just trying to live the day, expecting a better tomorrow. I have to keep reminding myself from time to time if what I'm doing is something that is within my ideals and interests, or I'm just riding someone's (or something) wave. This is a life-long struggle as we know more about ourselves and what our "purpose" is.

I know it's hard because there are some aspects of your life, like chores and work meetings, to be just "BAU" or business as usual. For as long as they constitutes to the greater goal or the bigger thing such as earning X amount of money - they are never wrong. What's wrong is that, if you're blindsided in doing something without understanding "why" you're doing it. Take control of your life, the world needs more "doers" than followers.
