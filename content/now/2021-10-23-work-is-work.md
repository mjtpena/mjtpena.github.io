Work is just work. Business is just a series of transactions, numbers, and deliverables. Money is just an instrument. They all come and go. You can always have more if you spend more time and resources on it. I realized I don’t want to spend 100+ hours a week on work-related activities, while being blindsided thinking it’s for the best of “my family” where, in fact, I’m just serving myself.
