The workplace has transformed in the last 2 years because of the pandemic. There is now an emergence of concept around the type of work you do as a knowledge worker. There is synchronous and asynchronous work.

Synchronous work are the things when you have to be together and be in sync to do things together. These are usually held for workshops and meetings that there’s a clear contribution from everyone and a defined deadline to hit. This also applies to hackathons.

Asynchronous work is the type of workflow when people and teams don’t have to be at the same place at the same time to accomplish outcome. This is when you are waiting for various teams when they can deliver what they do, in order for you to move on with your tasks. 

I do a fine balance between synchronous and asynchronous work as I find different projects and tasks have different tempo on it. However, there is a big difference between “multi-tasking” and just hitting checkpoints and moving on to the next tasks at hand.
