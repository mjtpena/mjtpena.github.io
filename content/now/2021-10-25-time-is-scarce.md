The most scarce resource is your time and attention. Specially if you live and breathe “tech”, it’s very easy to get sidetracked and distracted. Often, we forget what really matters and what really brings a purposeful life to us. The best thing that you can give to support someone is your genuine, undivided attention. Experiencing the actual connection with someone is the reward.
