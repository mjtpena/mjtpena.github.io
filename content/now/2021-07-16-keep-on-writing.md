I have to keep on writing. Write what I feel. Write what I know. Start it, even if it’s just a draft. I have to keep on writing because eventually I will forget what’s on my head right now, I will forget what I’m feeling, I will forget the person living inside my body today. Write so that I can re-live each and every moment of it. 

I want to write all sorts of topic, from [DeFi] and [Blockchain], to [Microsoft Azure] and [DotNet5]. Even the simple day to day tools and technologies that I use, I would like to write about them.
