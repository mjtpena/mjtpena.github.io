I never really understood why I wanted a vertically mounted monitor. I mean, it's cool and "different" but I still haven't seen the real use case of it. I think the whole idea is for it to be just open on the side and it's not really the primary focus for you to work on.

Based from my observation in the last couple of months, I find that all I need is 1 really good monitor, then everything else are extras. Whether the secondary is horizontal or vertical, it needs to be positioned as secondary. 

What I'll be doing is exploring this to monitor graphs such as stocks, cloud resources, and my always open notes. It's probably a good place to put on timers, music players like Spotify. #microblog
