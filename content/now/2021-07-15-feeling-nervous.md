It’s few minutes before my talk, and I still feel a little bit nervous about it. I’ve been speaking to conferences for almost a decade now and I had all sorts of experiences with it already. 

I’t okay to feel nervous, it means that you care about the event that is about to happen. It means that something alongside you values that aspect of life. Speaking is one of those things that I still get nervous time and time again, because I still care about it, I still want to improve about it.
