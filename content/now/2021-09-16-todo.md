You don’t wake up thinking “What should I do today?” For sure, you know what you want to do, you know what you “need” to do. You know what will give you that 1% progress in your career goals, habits, and spiritual wellbeing.

You should instead wake up saying “I will do this.” I want to do this “because.” When you convince yourself that you will commit to the action, it propels to getting things done. When things get done, that’s when you see progress. And continuous progress will lead to eventual “success.” 

And then you call it a day, you then sleep. Tomorrow, you do the same thing. Maybe you’ll be working on a different goal that time, maybe it’s the same boring task; whatever it is, you know you’re doing it towards success.
