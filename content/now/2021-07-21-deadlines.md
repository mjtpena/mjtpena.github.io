Sometimes I don't believe that there is such thing as a "deadline" or end of life for a project. You just define what you want to build given the time, resources, and talent that is available for you. A deadline could probably be re-word as a milestone or a target, in which there is a certain state that you're looking for a product to be developed. Deadlines are stressful, I want to avoid that word. Let's talk about milestones, targets, outcomes, and results!
