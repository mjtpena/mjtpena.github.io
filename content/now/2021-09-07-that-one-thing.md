The first thing that I do when I wake up is to think of “that one thing” for the day. This ceremony has been embodied for me since I was young. I actually can’t remember who thought me about it, or if I got it from someone. It’s probably a product of laziness and procrastination, that I’ll just sleep on things and whatever I think about tomorrow will be the one I’ll be doing.

It helped me a lot, as this allowed me to focus on “that one thing” early in the morning. This allows me to have a hard stop on something and feel accomplished and satisfied already for the day in terms of work. Anything else after that is spent on the family or something I can do without pouring a lot of energy and passion. 

Obviously, on some days, I wasn’t able to accomplish “that one thing” for a lot of reasons. But I think 5/7 in a week, I get it done. I would continue practicing this. This has helped me stay on track with my career trajectory and financial goals as well. As I keep on saying, you can do anything, but not everything. It’s important to understand that in the finite life that you have, you spend it on meaningful things that matter - with focus.
