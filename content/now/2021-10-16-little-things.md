Enjoy the little things. When we're working towards a huge and ambitious goal, we tend to be anxious about how we can get there. We then forget that it's actually a long journey, and you have to stop and rest once in a while. As part of this rest, you should also enjoy the simplest events in your life.

So what are these little things? Your child asking you to go for a play. The sunset. The sunrise. The good food that you're about to it. The new people that you meet. The little coding bug that you've solved. We often forget how important these are as we're so pre-occupied on the big things. Enjoying these little things on a daily basis will keep you motivated to move forward. You will then be surprised that the big goals will turn into a milestone you will just cross easily.
