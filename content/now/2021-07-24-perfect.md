There is no such thing as perfect. You'll just have to chase what's going to be perfect for you.  You will feel constant disappointment time and time again. Once you're in that treadmill of chasing perfection, you just keep getting hungry the further you go. Perfection is an enemy that most of us face when we're trying to do creative work like writing, coding, speaking, and art work. However, don't settle to mediocre. That's tasteless. Aim for competence, with effort - but not perfection.
