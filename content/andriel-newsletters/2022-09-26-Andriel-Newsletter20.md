# üè´ Therapies and Schools

## Therapies

### üéô Speech Therapy

Anh (Speech Therapist at Kids Therapy Hub) played with Andriel that targets various "B" sounds such as: Banana and Bus, as this is Andriel's current strength. Andriel was given a lot of opportunities to speak out from the "What's in the bag" activity as well as Giving objects to boy/girl.

One thing that the parents learned from Anh is that, words that are pronounced using "the back" is harder to pronounce than those that are spoken using "the front" part of the mouth. Example:

- Go (hard) that's why Andriel tends to say "Do"
- Cat (hard) is also hard, that's why Andriel tends to say "Tee"

We want to encourage Andriel to expand on using single words to saying 2-3 word phrases. For example: 'apple' - ‚Äúred apple‚Äù - ‚Äúeat apple‚Äù, "cut apple" - "no apple", ‚Äúapple gone‚Äù - "more apple"

### üß† Behaviour Therapy

Andriel continued to show progress with his behaviour therapy. Tuba was able to "level up" the difficulty of the activities. Andriel was still able to comply. From identification, now we're working on classification. Instead of just identifying "where is dog" vs "where is tiger", we now ask him "give animal" vs "give food". Andriel is still learning this, but is making good progress.

At home, we continuously support and supplement these techniques. Given that Andriel has a very good receptive skills, we always want to level that up in terms of molding behaviours. The challenge is still around recognising emotions as the concept is still very abstract for him. However, one thing that we noticed is that we can correlate sounds instead of image on to the emotion, example:

- Hahaha = happy
- Huhu = sad
- Ahhhhh = angry

### üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Occupational Therapy

Priya continuously work with Andriel on a bunch of play based activities. From puzzles, gross and motor skill activities, and even painting.

One thing that Andriel particularly loved is writing on to the foam. He was able to follow Priya's prompts to write numbers. You can see that Andriel was able to engage with this type of activities and there is a clear learning experience.

We have also adopted the "Star system" both for OT and Speech, so that the concept of Work vs Play becomes clear for Andriel.

## Pre-schools

### üåà SDN Beranga (Autism Specific)

Andriel had a lot of fun during the month of July and August.

A message from his educator:

> Andriel has responded well to the changes in the routine and is following the routine and transitioning with verbal prompts from educators with the occasional physical prompt or verbal reminder required. The new routine is providing Andriel with ample time to explore the morning activities and providing him with an opportunity to choose and be independent with his play and morning tea routine. During group time Andriel is being a role model to his peers by sitting in his allocated chair and participating when verbally prompted, other than recognising and labelling his name, lately, Andriel is showing interest in story times and following the story narration and labelling the animals from the "dear zoo" and "where is the green sheep" stories

### ü¶ã Papilio Ingleburn (Mainstream)

Andriel missed a couple of session due to getting sick and preparation for his baby brother. We'll keep you posted on updates with this on to the next newsletter.

## ü™ú Primary Schools

Still no updates from either Aspect or Austral Public School.

We are currently in the process of renewing Andriel's NDIS. This will come with new goals and plans as he's about to embark to a school setting next year.

# üè°Home and Family Activities

## Home Updates

üéâ Welcome to this world, baby brother! **Archael Marius** was born with normal delivery and is very healthy.

It's a big change for Andriel, as he is still getting used to having a little boy inside the house. He's not used to mommy and daddy carrying someone else besides him. It's a work in progress for him to recognise that he's now a "big brother".

We make sure that Andriel is involved on Archael's wellbeing. This ensures that we don't create an image for him around "just me" vs "just him" mentality. We encourage Andriel to participate in any baby activities from small gestures suc has:

- Tapping to help baby sleep
- "shhh" to calm the baby when he's crying
- Zipping his baby brother's clothes.

The family is fortunate to have a lot of support from the family. We were never alone in this journey. Both grand mothers from both sides are here to assist so that we can make sure that both kids are looked after. :)
