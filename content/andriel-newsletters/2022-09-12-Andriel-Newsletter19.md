## Therapies

### üéô Speech Therapy

- Andriel is now seeing Anh from Kids Therapy Hub.
- Andriel is continuously improving with his speech. He widens his vocabulary. The parents and educators always give him chances to speak when opportunity comes.
- Some activities to encourage Andriel to speak:
  - What's in the bag (to force him to say open and the item inside the bag)
  - Focused words (ball, bear, and other "B" sounds as it is his current strength)
  - Activities to encourage eye contacts such as balloons, mirror activities, and singing
- We also noticed that Andriel has been increasingly "chatty" and would keep saying the words "Hey", "Yawaa", "Bee bee", "Shee"

### üß† Behaviour Therapy

- Andriel has improved a lot since the beginning of the program with Tuba from Kids Therapy Hub.
- Some noticeable improvements include:
  - Having to sit down on an extended period of time.
  - Complying with commands and understanding the concept of rewards.
  - Can identify (and learn) most flash cards: animals, objects, toys.
- We've increased the difficulty of some activities such as instead of just identifying the animal (dog, cat, horse, etc) we now ask him to "classify" which is an animal vs food.
- We continuously teach Andriel about the different emotions (Angry, Happy, Sad) as this is one of his weaknesses. He struggles to both animated and live pictures. We were advised to use live pictures as much as possible, so that he can easily correlate this to "real world" scenarios.
- We also learned some tricks from Tuba on how to handle Andriel's tantrums:
  - Let him settle if he cries, but still continue with the activity. We don't want to reward crying as an escape behaviour.
  - Understand why he's frustrated (increased difficulty in activity, tired, not motivated). But still finish the set with easier difficulty ie: just ask him to clap to get a star.

### üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Occupational Therapy

- Andriel continuously improves in this area. Both his fine and gross motor skills have improved.
- His scissors handling skills are really good now. You can go on-and-on with just snipping papers non-stop. One of the activities that he loves playing to improve his fine motors is rescuing the animals: wrap the toy animals with rubber bands and he needs to remove it.
- Andriel also learns new skills quite easily such as operating bubble machines, magnets, and other sit-in activities.
- On a weekly basis, dad and Andriel now goes for a swim! This has always been a good way for Andriel to stimulate his sensory needs. On some occasions they also go for Flip Out, running, park plays to keep Andriel active.
- One thing that we noticed with Andriel though is that he tends to wee on his pants if not prompted for a toilet for a long time (2 hours+). He tends to wee when prompted on a regular basis. The poo on the other hand is something he feels and has the tendency to rush in to the toilet.

## Pre-schools

### üåà SDN Beranga (Autism Specific)

Andriel continuously practice reciting his name. He is now progressing as he was now able to say "Andri". Andriel (for most times) doesn't have difficulty participating in grouped circle activities. He would be able to sit down for an extended period of time.

Andriel participates and have increased awareness in terms of safety training. He can prompt for "stop" and "go".

Andriel is noticed to be doing a lot of item-throwing. For this, the educators introduced activities such as throw boards and throw pillows to substitute this behavior on to something more functional.

### ü¶ã Papilio Ingleburn (Mainstream)

Andriel is always excited to go to Papilio. He is very comfortable with the crowd and continuously listens to his educators. As always, he loves the outdoor play with the sand pit and would always go home with a lot of sand in his clothes! :D

He participates on some activities and have improved focused since then. He eats very well and prompts when asked to go to toilets.

## ü™ú Primary Schools

- Unfortunately no good news yet regarding Andriel's placement for next year.
- We'll hear more from both Austral Public School and Aspect Western Sydney at around 1st week October of this year.

### Kids Therapy Hub - School Readiness Program

- Andriel is currently attending Kids Therapy Hub's school readiness program.
- At first, he struggles to understand the setting as it's a new place and new set of people. But after a few more weeks of session, he gets to settle in.
- In this program, they do various activities with Ms. Elizabeth and company, to prepare them for the big school. Some activities include:
  - moulding lion clay
  - writing and art based activities

# üè°Home and Family Activities

## Home Updates

At home, Andriel shows affection to both of his parents. At night, he would prompt both mom and dad to sleep with him as he gestures by (manding) pulling the parents' hand to the bed. In any pocket time of the day, he would ask for a hug or kiss from his parents. Same applies in outdoor settings as well, he would want both of his hands to be held (even sometimes with Dad + stranger).

He understands the construct of the house, and would follow routines. One thing in particular that he likes playing are "clothes hanger" as the shape is obscure and something that can be stacked side by side. When prompted, he can pack away items and toys. On some occasions, he also helps with carrying clothes for washing.

Andriel understood at home that most things such as food (even if it's in the pantry) needs to be with consent before eating - so he would look at you and ask for "Appy (apple)" or "Wa (water)". He is well trained these past few weeks to "sit while eating" to avoid him going for a run while carrying food. He also needs to pack away his plates on to the kitchen sink after eating.

We also give him awareness of the "baby" and would supplement him with pictures / books that shows having a little baby around.
