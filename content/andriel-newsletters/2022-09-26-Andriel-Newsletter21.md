## üöÅ Therapies

### üéô Speech Therapy

Andriel's speech has improved significantly in recent months, as he has been working hard to learn new words and phrases. He is now able to utter first syllable of words and can even express his thoughts and feelings with good eye contact and gestures. His receptive skills are also allowing him to comprehend more complex language, which is helping him to engage more effectively with his peers and family members.

Anh (Speech Therapist) implements focus words for the week. Andriel is also encouraged to speak when playing. He is still having a hard time with words pronounced at the back (like "Go" is still pronounced as "Do"). Anh helps Andriel with his pronunciation by teaching him specific techniques to help him improve. Anh starts by breaking down the sound of each word and having Andriel repeat it slowly and clearly.

She also provides visual cues, such as animal visuals, to show him what he is doing wrong and how he can improve. Additionally, Anh uses activities such as games and puzzles to practice sounds and words with Andriel in a fun way. Finally, she encourages Andriel to speak out loud as much as possible, even if it is just one word at a time. We're very happy to have Anh as Andriel's speech therapist!

### üß† Behaviour Therapy

Andriel is able to understand the concept of hard work and that when work is finished, he will get rewarded later. This has been effective in managing Andriel's behaviour in a `study` setting. The star system works by setting clear expectations for behaviour and providing rewards when those expectations are met. It encourages Andriel to focus on his tasks and the rewards serves as motivation for him to stay on task. This approach also allows for Andriel to develop a sense of accomplishment when he completes a task and is rewarded for it. It also reinforces positive behaviour which can be beneficial in the long run.

Tuba (Behaviour Therapist) explained that Andriel is getting better in general as his focus and listening skills are very good now. He is also showing more interest in activities and is better able to follow instructions. He is also more confident and is able to express himself better by saying "No" appropriately.

Andriel still struggles with some sensory challenges, but he has made significant progress in his ability to process sensory information. He has also become more flexible when presented with different scenarios or tasks.

Overall, Andriel has made tremendous progress since starting therapy with Tuba and both Andriel and his family are very pleased with the results.

### üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Occupational Therapy

Andriel loves going to Kids Therapy Hub for Preya's (Occupation Therapist) session. Andriel has improved a lot in his gross and fine motor skills. We are so proud of Andriel's progress! Preya has been an amazing Occupational Therapist, providing him with the necessary tools and guidance to help him improve his skills. From scissors cutting, art activities, turn taking plays, and much more!

We are also very thankful for Preya's support to the parents in terms of further equipping us with tools and strategies to try out for Andriel's improvements. Her patience is really admirable as a lot of times, Andriel comes to the session in a under-stimulated or over-stimulated behaviour. Preya still manages to achieve something out of those sessions.

Unfortunately, it was Preya's last week. Goodbye, Preya! We'll miss you. Wishing you all the best in your new adventure.

## üöå Pre-schools

### üåà SDN Beranga (Autism Specific)

Andriel wraps up with SDN Beranga this week! He has learned a lot from the pre-school. It makes the long distance drive worth it, as we see Andriel excited and comfortable at the school setting. The whole family also attended the school's Christmas party and managed to meet the rest of the educators and fellow parents.

He has learned basic life skills like following routines, how to interact with others, and how to take care of himself such as toileting and feeding. He was able to gain valuable skills such as fine motor development, dexterity, hand-eye coordination, creativity, social skills and communication skills. We also see him learning about the world around him; from the art, safety, he's been able to explore and learn. In addition, he's been able to make new friends (or at other kids treating him as one) and create lasting relationships with his teachers and peers.

His educators and the rest of the SDN Team helped a lot for Andriel's school readiness, and Primary school representative visits, and also providing a One-Page-Profile for his transition to the big school. As we say goodbye for now, we are confident that Andriel will apply the things he has learned here at SDN Beranga in his daily life.

### ü¶í Kids Theraphy Hub School Readiness

Andriel joined Kids Therapy Hub's school readiness program. It's a structured "classroom" type setting where students are taught things that are expected when they go to the big school next year. From packing a lunch box, doing physical education, and sit down activities.

He joined two seasons of it. He graduated with remarks from his educator that he has improved a lot since the first day. It's so rewarding to see Andriel make such great progress in such a short amount of time. Congratulations to Andriel and his educators for their hard work!

## ü™ú Primary Schools

After the long wait, we finally had news about Andriel's primary school for next year! The family was a bit disappointed that it's not until the end of the year that we received news about Andriel's potential placement. Andriel got accepted to not just one, but TWO placements:

- ASPECT Western Sydney (Autism Specific)
- Kemps Creek Public School with Support classes

We chose ASPECT Western Sydney as the parents believe that this is the best option for Andriel right now as they are specialised to children within the spectrum. It is indeed, with the long term goal that Andriel also joins a mainstream class and will have minimal supervision - which the parents are confident that it is achievable.

All the paperwork are sorted now (just pending the uniforms) and Andriel even had a chance to visit the school. He loves the place as it's wide and a lot of fun things to do. When dad was about to pick him up, he doesn't even want to go home yet.

To even close it of, Andriel's application for Assistance Travel Program (sponsored by the government) got approved. This means, Andriel gets to have safe point-to-point travel from home to school every weekday!

## üè° Home Updates

We recently had a family picture taken to immortalise Archael's celebration of birth. Andriel used to be the sole focus and attention of the family, and things have changed since Archael's birth. His receptive skills are also helping him to communicate better with others, as he can understand the instructions that are given to him at home .

After spending more time with the baby. Andriel doesn't show any more pinching or irritation towards his brother. He is now comfortable with Archael's presence. On some occassions, he can hug and kiss his little brother when prompted. Archael is showing signs of being talkative which is the opposite of Andriel who obviously prefers to speak less.

We make sure to spend quality time with both of them. We play with them, talk to them, and soon will read stories together. Furthermore, we also encourage Andriel to express himself and talk about his feelings by asking "what's wrong?" or "are you happy?" so he can feel secure and accepted. By engaging in activities that both of them will enjoy, we can bond as a family and create a strong connection between the two brothers.

At home, we focus on reinforcing the skills he has already learned while introducing new tasks and activities that are developmentally appropriate. We use a variety of activities to help him learn in a fun and engaging way. Some of these activities may include:

- Practicing his communication skills through verbal, sign language, and picture cards
- Playing interactive games that are educational and enjoyable
- Engaging in sensory activities to help develop his fine motor skills
- Exploring his environment with structured play and outdoor activities
- Using visuals such as flashcards to support learning new words or concepts
- Using music to support learning language, rhythm, and movement
- Reading short books that are engaging and educational
- Participating in arts and crafts projects to practice such as gluing and cutting

## üì∏ Photos and Activities

We have wonderful news! The family are now citizens of Australia. It's been more than 5 years now, and Australia is indeed - home.

Andriel enjoys the company of his dad. They play a lot of games such as wrestling. Andriel also loves to go on swings and bike with his dad. He can communicate with dad by having good eye contact and saying "Push" to mean that he wants dad to push him on to the swing; as well as saying "Bah" and points to the bike to say that he wants a bike ride.

House build is progressing really well. We're just few months away until Andriel gets to be in a new neighbourhood. We're so excited for this! Likewise, we know it'll be a great place for him to start his school age life.
