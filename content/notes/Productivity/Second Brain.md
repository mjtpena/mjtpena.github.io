Building a Second Brain

## Borrowed Creativity. 

Creativity is about remixing ideas based from what you consume (read, watch, listen). Adding your own spin into that. There is no such thing as “original idea”    

## The capture habit. 

Capture ideas as soon as possible because our brain hold on to it for a very long time. Once it’s stored somewhere, we move on. “Our brain is for ha big ideas, not storing them”

## Idea recycling. 

Ideas are not single use. Re-use information in the future. Your notes can be used to different projects.

## Projects over categories. 

Don’t categorise based on folders like “Marketing”, “Motivation”, etc. Dump ideas first, then push them to projects.

## Slow burns vs heavy lifts. 

Heavy lift is like allocating 2 full days to finish something. Fulfil projects in small increments. This is pretty much mix of Agile/Scrum methodology.

## Start with Abundance. 

Don’t start with an empty canvas. Search from your data bank and pull bits and pieces and tie them together. Work on what’s missing. Work more on what needs improvement.

## Intermediate packets. 

A project is divided into major sections “packets”. Packets are re-usable and can be “dragged and drop” to different projects. For example: headings, section 1, section 2, conclusion, etc.

## You only know what you make. 

We only understood a media (video, podcast, blogs) if we reflect on it like summarising it. We become more engaged with it. We become more creative with it. Don’t just consume, don’t just highlight, take notes and do the effort to summarise.

## Make it easier for your future self. 

Create a resource that your future self will find useful. Don’t just do “vague notes” such as titles or topic names. Do the effort to make meaning of these notes. It becomes a treasure chest for your future self.  

## Keep your ideas moving. 

Don’t fall to the trap of perfectionism. Don’t focus on the shininess of the tool (gold plating). Focus on creating creative output. Even if you saved all of your files, notes, videos if you don’t do something with it (move ideas) then it’s worthless.
