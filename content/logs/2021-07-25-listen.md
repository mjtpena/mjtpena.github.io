Learn to shut up. It's easier said than done. Especially if you grew up to speak what's on your mind. However, we weren't taught how to listen - like properly listen to a person, surrounding, a video, and even thoughts. There are so many things in this life that you can learn if you just sit, focus, and listen carefully. Listen. You can talk when it's the right time.
