# Introduction

Blockchain is not dead. Actually, quite the contrary is happening in the past year. There are more and more interest and it's gaining a lot more traction than before. A big portion of this growth is due to "DeFi" AKA Decentralised Finance applications. From the hyped cryptocurrencies, we are now seeing the new next wave of this transformation as we see more financial products being developed: lending, exchanges, yield farming, and pools just to name a few. It is a hot topic right now and there are a lot of demand in this space. There are also a lot of opportunities to start creating your own innovative products as part of this wave.

DeFi is similar to how we call Financial Technologies as "FinTech". It's an industry vertical use of decentralised technologies that are specific to financial products. This includes exchanges, lending & borrowing, interests & compounds, staking & liquidity pools, and many more. 

One of the key advantages of DeFi is the decentralised nature of it. No central entity have "control" on the network of exchanges and transactions. A DeFi product can be in a form of a smart contract that allows state changes of values ie set business rules.
- The DeFi product is permissionless, anyone with a phone or PC can access it.
- The DeFi application usually gets a portion of the transaction.
- The DeFi application cannot shut down the network.

# What makes a product DeFi?
