# 🏫 Therapies and Schools

## Therapies

### 🎙 Speech Therapy

- Andriel met Sarah (Kids Therapy Hub) for the first time. We played some scanning (letters) using flash cards. Did a lot of counting.
- For next session, Sarah plans to implement a more conducive environment for learning without a lot of distractions in place.
- Beth (Cross Care) sent her handover report to us.

### 🧠 Behaviour Therapy

☹️ We missed this forthnight’s session. We supplemented it with Andriel’s training at home (see below)

⚙️ Andriel had a cognitive assessment with Istvan Schreiner from Comprehensive Psychology. We were lucky that Istvan had an earlier availability as it’s very difficult to schedule a cognitive assessment. The report has been forwarded to Aspect Western Sydney and we will forward it to schools and therapists.

Istvan ran a limited amount of Stanford Binet tests (IQ test based from pattern matching) and the parents filled up an ABAS 2 questionnaire.

### 🚴‍♀️ Occupational Therapy

- We only had one session since last update.
- Andriel continues to like the swings and we teach him how to kick.
- Andriel continues to perform sit in activities with a lot of prompting.
- Andriel had some pee incidents when wearing thick clothes and while it was cold. These past few days, he’s back in routine and has consistently not peed on his pants for as long as we follow a schedule.

## Pre-schools

### 🌈 SDN Beranga (Autism Specific)

- He is very switched on at School. The educator (Bubbles) thinks he’s very teachable.
- Andriel participates in group activities and can sit for a long period of time. There are also different type of chairs that he can use to remain seated. He doesn’t have much problem staying for activities these days.
- As part of school readiness, they advised us to bring a water bottle as this is one of the key difference in a school setting.
- Other observation includes:
  - He doesn’t have much problem with the presence of other kids. However we want to work out his “play” with other kids.
  - He tends to move on if someone tries to grab his toy, same thing he does when it’s someone’s toy. Sometimes conflict happens and the educators are there to avoid it.

### 🦋 Papilio Ingleburn (Mainstream)

Andriel is always comfortable going to Papilio. He particularly likes to go out when the weather is nice to play in the sand pit.

Papilio sent over Andriel’s mid year report. Here is the summary:

> Within the prep room Andriel has formed relationships with his educators but Andriel prefers to play alone in solitary play and like to move from different learning area within the room to explore his own learning and experiences. Andriel is able to communicate some of his needs to his educators in a non-verbal way. There are times that with some encouragement from his educators that Andriel will participate in planned experiences but this will only be for a few minutes and then he will go off and explore on his own again. Some of Andriel's current interests: Dinosaurs and Animals, Blocks, and Sanpit Play.

## 🪜 Primary Schools

- Austral Public School have submitted Andriel’s files. We will now wait for a couple of months until we hear back if he gets a placement for next year.
- We’ve forwarded the cognitive assessment to ASPECT Western Sydney and we’ll be waiting for next steps.

### ASPECT Macarthur Open Day

The family attended Attended ASPECT Macarthur’s Open Day. The event is jam packed with a lot of activities for the kids to enjoy. One of the highlights of the event is seeing a diverse set of children in the spectrum performing on stage!

The parents also attended the seminars of Dr. Jane Warren (University of Wollongon) and Lee Casuscelli (Deputy National Director, Aspect Education); and had a good refresher about Autism and Inclusivity. The parents also picked a lot of real life experiences, struggles, and success stories that people in the spectrum had. They also had the opportunity to have a chat with the principal and other educators in the campus. It was a very welcoming and engaging environment - to say the least.

Andriel was so happy and well stimulated with all the activities in the campus.

# 🏡Home and Family Activities

## Home Updates

At home, we’ve focused on teaching Andriel the concept of “Reward System” by accumulating stars after performing certain tasks.

When prompted he can do the activity in prompt of him:

- reciting A to Z from flash cards
- identifying animals and shapes by saying “Give …”
- hand-to-hand prompt of writing

He is still learning the ways of earning “3 stars” then reward. This will be a challenge for him in the next few weeks as he’s more used to having things just by gesturing “give” or pointing.

## 📸 Photos and Activities

### 🏔 Snowy Mountains

The family (extended) had a lot of fun staying at the east side of Lake Jindabyne where we enjoyed the freezing nature weather and sceneries.

At night, we setup a camp fire to keep us warm outside.

Andriel is very comfortable with the people around him, and would hold hands or hug his cousin “Milly” from time to time. Andriel is showing a lot of affection, and would ensure that he’s holding people’s hands when walking.

Andriel enjoyed playing with snow. He enjoys making snow balls and throwing them up. He did enjoy a couple of toboggan rides with dad.

The family for sure had a lot of fun. The view from Perisher’s peak lookout is just astonishing. It’s so white that it feels like the clouds and snow are connected.

# ⏭️ What's coming and Notes from Parents?

- We’ve enrolled Andriel to Kids Therapy Hub’s school readiness program. This is a structured environment where kids like Andriel will be given a chance to experience a “school like” setting that’s appropriate for them. We will also have the experience of preparing a lunch box for him!
- 2 of Andriel’s Grand Mothers are going to stay at the house for a couple of months. This is to assist with the baby on the way, and also to make sure we have all the hands we need in the coming months. :)
- Spring time is coming very soon (and less rain), so we’ll make sure Andriel gets a lot of sun time outside!
