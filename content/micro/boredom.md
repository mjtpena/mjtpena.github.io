It's okay to be bored from time to time. It means that you don't have something that is urgent and important. It's bad to be bored if it's a coping mechanism to avoid stress. A right amount of stress is good for you, to keep you challenged and energised - also in a way have purpose in life. Aim to have boring days, so that out of the stressful day, you have some time to recharge and contemplate on what's really important for you.
