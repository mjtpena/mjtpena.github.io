      <description>For the longest of time, I would consider myself as the lone wolf at work. Most days, I&amp;rsquo;d rather stay alone and be in my world to get things done. I found in the past that the effort to collaborate is counterintuitive and would just mean more work for me. Back then, I&amp;rsquo;d rather do things &amp;ldquo;my way&amp;rdquo; than to delegate so that I don&amp;rsquo;t get disappointed with the results from someone else.</description>

      <description>People have asked me lately, how do I do it? Having a full-time consulting company, spending quality time with family, doing groceries, cooking, house errands, taking part at online communities, blogging, journaling, building a house, getting involved to a dozen startups, creating a podcast, reading books, losing weight, and the list goes on.
It&amp;rsquo;s even harder because it&amp;rsquo;s the pandemic. Most people&amp;rsquo;s motivation and morale are down right now because of the never ending lockdowns, non-purposeful workplace, fear of missing out, and other negative emotions.</description>

      <description>Someone once asked me, what does it take to become a prominent developer? A 10X Engineer? You know some who are &amp;ldquo;extraordinary&amp;rdquo;. What do you mean by extraordinary? I&amp;rsquo;ve always had some thoughts (all of us do) around it, but my understanding and opinion of it is now much more concrete. Actually, this applies not only to being a developer, but to any other career or profession that you&amp;rsquo;re in.</description>
