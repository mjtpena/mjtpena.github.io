      <description>For the longest of time, I would consider myself as the lone wolf at work. Most days, I&amp;rsquo;d rather stay alone and be in my world to get things done. I found in the past that the effort to collaborate is counterintuitive and would just mean more work for me. Back then, I&amp;rsquo;d rather do things &amp;ldquo;my way&amp;rdquo; than to delegate so that I don&amp;rsquo;t get disappointed with the results from someone else.</description>

      <description>People have asked me lately, how do I do it? Having a full-time consulting company, spending quality time with family, doing groceries, cooking, house errands, taking part at online communities, blogging, journaling, building a house, getting involved to a dozen startups, creating a podcast, reading books, losing weight, and the list goes on.
It&amp;rsquo;s even harder because it&amp;rsquo;s the pandemic. Most people&amp;rsquo;s motivation and morale are down right now because of the never ending lockdowns, non-purposeful workplace, fear of missing out, and other negative emotions.</description>

      <description>One of the colossal beasts that all knowledge workers fight time and time again is procrastination. This is when you know you should work, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough willpower to do it. You can&amp;rsquo;t code, you can&amp;rsquo;t do that design document, you can&amp;rsquo;t write that next blog post&amp;hellip; the list goes on. Here are 5 of my usual methods when I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in that limbo.
Avoid Distractions The first and obvious thing that you have to do is to avoid distraction.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s very tempting to click on &amp;ldquo;that next button&amp;rdquo; wether that is from YouTube, Netflix, Facebook videos or any endless buffet of consumption. You start watching a video about a topic you&amp;rsquo;re really interested in to and end up watching something weird after 3 hours. As I do more research in my personal journey of Digital Intentionalization, this is probably one of the most obvious ones. We let the platform play the next content.</description>

      <description>During the holidays, I was contemplating on what skills should I invest time on for 2021. As someone who is working in the technology field, there are a lot of exciting things to double-down on: from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and a plethora of technology trends. As I reflected on how my 2020 went in terms of career and lifestyle, I noticed that there is an area I really need to work on - my digital life.</description>
