      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I started a campaign to raise money into my Run For Autism 2021. Long story short, I made it! Raising the money, running the distance, and raising more awareness. It&amp;rsquo;s been a challenging journey given I experienced a lot of adversaries along the way.
Here are some of the key takeaways of this journey: - Always define the purpose - Set realistic expectations - Love the process - Deliver what you&amp;rsquo;ve committed - Know when to rest</description>

      <description>For the longest of time, I would consider myself as the lone wolf at work. Most days, I&amp;rsquo;d rather stay alone and be in my world to get things done. I found in the past that the effort to collaborate is counterintuitive and would just mean more work for me. Back then, I&amp;rsquo;d rather do things &amp;ldquo;my way&amp;rdquo; than to delegate so that I don&amp;rsquo;t get disappointed with the results from someone else.</description>

      <description>People have asked me lately, how do I do it? Having a full-time consulting company, spending quality time with family, doing groceries, cooking, house errands, taking part at online communities, blogging, journaling, building a house, getting involved to a dozen startups, creating a podcast, reading books, losing weight, and the list goes on.
It&amp;rsquo;s even harder because it&amp;rsquo;s the pandemic. Most people&amp;rsquo;s motivation and morale are down right now because of the never ending lockdowns, non-purposeful workplace, fear of missing out, and other negative emotions.</description>
