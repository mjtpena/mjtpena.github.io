      <description>Hybrid cloud is the trend right now I see in a lot of companies and enterprises. The term hybrid has grown too in the last couple of years. It used to be just the connectivity between an on-premises data center to public clouds like AWS and Azure. This time, hybrid now also includes multi-cloud and edge computing. It&amp;rsquo;s about borderless connectivity across different topologies or deployment models happening around.
Why hybrid cloud?</description>

      <title>Using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for Blockchain Development</title>

      <description>In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my Macbook Pro to do all things blockchain and smart contracts development. One of the hurdles I encountered in the past is that some tooling and frameworks were not first class citizens on Windows. Majority of these tools, especially those that come with scripts and complex networking architecture (circa 2015) just works in MacOS and Linux:Ubuntu.
Introduction Of course there have been a lot of improvements now in the ecosystem since then.</description>

      <title>What are these blockchain and crypto tokens?</title>

      <description>So you keep hearing or reading about &amp;ldquo;tokens&amp;rdquo;, these &amp;ldquo;cryptos&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;blockchain bitcoins&amp;rdquo;, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite some time now that it has involved me with blockchains and cryptos that over and over, I have to explain to people (often new clients) on what are these tokens. Even until now, at almost late 2021, I still get asked about these: Is it Bitcoin? Is it Ethereum? Is it Coin X, Coin Y?</description>

      <title>Developing MacOS Apps using .NET</title>

      <description>The .NET framework (and the wider ecosystem) has embraced a lot of openness these past few years. Gone are the days when .NET only works on Windows. However, as the journey to &amp;ldquo;One .NET&amp;rdquo; is still unfolding, there is a lot of confusion on how we can use .NET on MacOS. There is Mono, .NET Core, .NET 5, Xamarin.Mac, Xamarin.Forms, Mac Catalyst, .NET 6, and MAUI. This blog post explains some of the core concepts across these nomenclature.</description>

      <description>Introduction Blockchain is not dead. Actually, quite the contrary is happening in the past year. There are more and more interest and it&amp;rsquo;s gaining a lot more traction than before. A big portion of this growth is due to &amp;ldquo;DeFi&amp;rdquo; AKA Decentralised Finance applications. From the hyped cryptocurrencies, we are now seeing the new next wave of this transformation as we see more financial products being developed: lending, exchanges, yield farming, and pools just to name a few.</description>

      <title>My Ultimate Windows and Mac Setup (2021 Edition)</title>

      <description>Introduction My Battle Station @ 2021
In a parallel world, I&amp;rsquo;ll be just using 1 device and 1 Operating system for all the things. However, given the nature of my work with mobile, web, blockchain, machine learning, and cloud development, I need to have multiple devices to cater things.
I tried doing &amp;ldquo;Shared mouse and keyboard&amp;rdquo; in the past such as Synergy, but I decided to use a KVM switch instead.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time lately in setting up on-premises Linux Servers. There are a lot of reasons why you would like to SSH to a Linux server such as checking configuration files, copying files, or even port forwarding.
Just open your MacOS terminal and the command to ssh to a Linux Server is as simple as:
ssh user@host or ssh michael@192.0.0.1
However, where it gets tricky is when you need to use a proxy such as SOCKS5 in order to access that Linux server from your MacOS machine.</description>

      <description>Wow! It‚Äôs been 5 years since my first Microsoft MVP award. If you don‚Äôt know what the Microsoft MVP program is, check this site. Throughout the years, I have transitioned from various categories and technology award. In particular, Windows Development (Windows 8/8.1/10/RT and XAML), to Developer Technologies (C#, .NET, Xamarin), to Azure with focus on Blockchain, PAAS (Platform as a Service), and Integrations.
In those years, I‚Äôve seen Microsoft and the MVP program changed a lot (for the better).</description>
