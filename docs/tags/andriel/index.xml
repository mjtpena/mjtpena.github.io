      <description>📰 What&amp;rsquo;s New? Therapy updates More 1 word sounds School updates Andriel’s birthday 🏫 Therapies and Schools Therapies 🎙 Speech Therapy 👋 We said goodbye to Bethany Price. Beth has been a big part of Andriel’s growth in the past 2 years. As we reflect on the past 2 years, Andriel have learned a lot of skills. From being non-verbal, poor receptive skills, and extreme lack of focus. Now Andriel can speak simple words (or at least will attempt), he has better awareness of things happening around him, and can now comply with simple instructions.</description>
