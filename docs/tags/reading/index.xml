      <description>Ever since I was a kid, I was never really the person who watches the mainstream television to watch news. Watching news on a television is a culture that a lot of people just grew up with as a &amp;ldquo;default.&amp;rdquo;
Here are some of thoughts on why I don&amp;rsquo;t value reading or watching mainstream media anymore.
The important news will come to you one way or the other. They are written or crafted to trigger emotions rather than inform about things.</description>

      <description>Before 2018, I was never a book reader. Reading a book seems like a chore to me. I can barely finish a chapter. I always had that internal conflict (possibly based from childhood experience) that only &amp;ldquo;the smart people&amp;rdquo; can read books. Another factor is, I&amp;rsquo;ve always associated books to &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;academia&amp;rdquo; that felt like an enclosed culture that didn&amp;rsquo;t really synced in to me. Also, I&amp;rsquo;d rather watch a film or TV series than read a 300 to 500 pager book - because of cinematics.</description>
