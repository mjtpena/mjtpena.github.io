        <p>Meetings are one of the killers of productivity. Specially if you have other functions or roles beside attending and organizing meetings. For example, if you&rsquo;re also a developer or a knowledge person who needs enough focus to get on with a productive and meaningful outcome.</p>
<p>Some meetings are really ideal when there are so many unknowns and we want to collaborate and just get on with it, instead of bouncing on/off with emails and chat. However, in my opinion, it would only make sense if all or most of the attendees are participating. I don&rsquo;t get the reason of participating in events if I won&rsquo;t even be talking or what others are talking about doesn&rsquo;t relate to me.</p>
<p>I am becoming more notorious in missing meetings and all the FYI town halls and events. However, I am also noticing that I&rsquo;m getting more productive output done, as I don&rsquo;t get too much distracted with things. I do attend meetings if something is burning, or we&rsquo;re planning something meaningful and there will be clear actions for everyone right after the event.</p>

        <p>Trolls are people on the internet who have the intention of getting in to your nerves by distracting you with bashful or hurtful comments. They are masked with a fake account and doesn&rsquo;t really show who they are and how they are related to you. Some of them are just completely random, some of them are targeted from your peers and network.</p>
<p>The moment you entertain them, then they become successful on what they intended to do. So the best course of action is to just ignore them. I haven&rsquo;t experienced that much trolling in my life, as I am not really in the mood for a fight and would be better of spending that time to something else. I don&rsquo;t tolerate them. I don&rsquo;t even think about them late at night.</p>
<p>For as long as you and your family is safe, then you don&rsquo;t really have to worry about it that much. Some people are just bored and miserable in their lives, and got nothing better to do. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a question of who really suffers and how. For as long as you don&rsquo;t get affected mentally and you still get ahead of your day, then all should be fine. You only have limited amount of time and energy in this world, so better spend them somewhere that makes more impact and sense - things that you really care about.</p>

        <p>The best advice you can give to someone (or even yourself) is &ldquo;to become a serial achiever.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;to be rich&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be successful&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be the best X professional&rdquo;. Most of these are too vague, too shallow, too specific, and most of the time not relatable and practical for the rest of 99% population. Also, continuity is important as this brings you on to &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next&rdquo; after reaching a specific outcome.</p>
<p>Serial achievers are great into many things. Maybe you want to become a successful entrepreneur AND a passionate gamer while being a great husband. Be an author &amp; public speaker while being a supportive parent to your son. Maybe what you want is to become an expert in a specific field/technology and a tri-athlete, while maintaining a successful portfolio of investments. Maybe an accountant who have a successful YouTube channel. A global executive of a multi-national company and an active member of a spiritual community while being a good friend.</p>
<p>Whatever ANDs you choose, something has to give - and that&rsquo;s fine. You can also keep changing priorities as you reach certain milestones. Note that you can&rsquo;t have it all, but you can definitely do a lot. And that lot, is enough to live a happy and purposeful life.</p>

        <p>I never really understood why I wanted a vertically mounted monitor. I mean, it&rsquo;s cool and &ldquo;different&rdquo; but I still haven&rsquo;t seen the real use case of it. I think the whole idea is for it to be just open on the side and it&rsquo;s not really the primary focus for you to work on.</p>
<p>Based from my observation in the last couple of months, I find that all I need is 1 really good monitor, then everything else are extras. Whether the secondary is horizontal or vertical, it needs to be positioned as secondary.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ll be doing is exploring this to monitor graphs such as stocks, cloud resources, and my always open notes. It&rsquo;s probably a good place to put on timers, music players like Spotify.</p>

        <p>Lockdown fatigue is real. At first, I thought that this is something that is just playing on my head that I can eventually overcome. It&rsquo;s actually way tougher because you&rsquo;re feeling a bit stuck in where you are. Physically, you can&rsquo;t go anywhere else and movement makes you feel progress and general freedom.</p>
<p>The problem is that, there is no guarantee on when this will be over, or when things are going to ease up a little. It&rsquo;s not really about going out or going places, it&rsquo;s more around the fear set in stone that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t&rdquo; because there are dire consequences whether that&rsquo;s safety or penalties. This is affecting my family so much, specially my kid who is seeking for sensory stimulus from outdoor activities.</p>
<p>I am optimistic and very hopeful that things will ease up a little this October 2021, and my kid can go back to school, attend some extracurricular activities like swimming, and I can also go in to places within the region. I miss some weekend drivings or be somewhere elese.</p>

        <p>Five minutes seem to a be a lot of time but also too little in the grander scheme of things. You can a bug in a line of code, in few minutes, but it might take you days to solve the real issues around it. All you need is to make sure you try to achieve a very small task in least amount of time possible.</p>
<p>When writing these short snips of &ldquo;freewriting&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t want to spend more than 5 minutes. It&rsquo;s just the enough time to get something rolling and at the same time not really get in to the topic for so long. I make sure that I&rsquo;m focused and undistracted on that time window, so that I&rsquo;ll know if what I&rsquo;m writing will eventually be worth pursuing.</p>
<p>The idea of dissecting tasks to a certain amount of time works for me, as this allows me to be wiser with the use of time and resources that I have. Action always propel to something, and 5 minutes is enough to take the first step.</p>

        <p>Waking up at the wrong side of the bed. That is a classic saying when it&rsquo;s early in the morning and people around you notices that you&rsquo;re not in the best mood as they observe your face. There are days when you wake up feeling sour and unproductive. You don&rsquo;t feel like doing something productive like working on your goals, writing &amp; journaling, or anything that requires a certain amount of effort to move.</p>
<p>The key is to move and get started somewhere. Just do even the tiniest progress you can do for the goals that you&rsquo;re setting. Once you&rsquo;ve propelled yourself to move, the power of inertia kicks in and will get the ball rolling on your mind and body. It&rsquo;s weird, but that&rsquo;s just how our body works. There isn&rsquo;t any magic on being motivated, you&rsquo;ll just have to do the hard work as part of the process.</p>
<p>Know that the difference between a good and bad day (in your perspective) is something only you can control. It is how you react on certain events and movements. It&rsquo;s how you plan your actions and focus on what you want to do. So get out there and start moving, you just need that first tiny step of action.</p>
