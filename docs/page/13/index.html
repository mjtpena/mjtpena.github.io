        So you keep hearing or reading about &ldquo;tokens&rdquo;, these &ldquo;cryptos&rdquo;, the &ldquo;blockchain bitcoins&rdquo;, and so on. It&rsquo;s been quite some time now that it has involved me with blockchains and cryptos that over and over, I have to explain to people (often new clients) on what are these tokens.

        <p>Sydney is home for me. When I first came here on 2011, I already knew that this place is home and this is where I want to grow a family. There are so many things I like about Sydney: having both my sisters here and extended family, from food and people diversity, a lot of friends I met along the way. It brought me a lot of opportunity, from being a coder, consultant, and entrepreneur; I thrived in this place. The culture fits me right. The wine, steak, beach, BBQ; they all speak to me.</p>
<p>Although there are a lot of things I miss from the Philippines, I know this is the place for me right now. I love the work and environment that I have, it is more than a comfort zone. I am very thankful that I&rsquo;m here right now. I am contributing to this economy and society as much as I can.</p>

        <p>Sometimes we experience a state of &ldquo;mental block&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s when we can&rsquo;t think creatively or logically to solve a specific problem. This happens for a lot of reasons such as lack of energy, hunger, distraction, and lack of comprehension to the subject matter.</p>
<p>Whenever I get stuck with a problem, I leave it on a state when I can resume it later on. That means I have to make sure I capture all the important notes about it before I leave. I then move on to either a different task or take a long break.</p>
<p>Funny enough, sometimes you will have the answers at the weirdest of time such as while in the toilet, first thing you think in the morning, or when someone says something and you connect the dots. Sometimes the answer is actually obvious, and you just needed rest or undivided attention.</p>
<p>So when next time you experience a mental block, do this: make all the necessary notes, take a rest or pivot to different task, then come back to it later on.</p>

        <p>Trust is a currency that is both common and unique to humanity. Before currencies came to life, we use trust as the means of transaction. Even until now, with all the cryptocurrencies and related technologies, it&rsquo;s still Trust that we are trying to bridge the gap. These technologies just advance the automation and the &ldquo;skunk work&rdquo; from an operations stand point, but the actual entity who represents it cannot be replaced with an AI (or at least far from it right now).</p>
<p>That is why even with the advancement of technology such as AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Blockchain, we as human, still want to trust a person or an entity. That&rsquo;s why brand loyalty still counts a lot. We&rsquo;re all funny creature, and we&rsquo;re all attracted to different shiny things in life. At its core, trust gives us all the promise of experience and plausible happiness in life. That is why, whenever a relationship whether personal or business is damaged, it&rsquo;s very hard to reconcile. The trust of that experience or happiness is now gone.</p>

        <p>There are some legitimate excuse in my opinion to burn the midnight oil - aka work late at night. I do this so that I don&rsquo;t have to work over the weekends, and I can spend a lot of quality time with my family. This also allows me to work on a task that I know I can finish, or at least hit a milestone of,  instead of procrastinating it for the next day or week (something I&rsquo;ve done a lot in the past). I only do it on Tuesdays and Thursdays these days.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ll do everyday. At least that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking of right now. Sometimes you&rsquo;re just in the flow, with no distractions, and free with your thoughts to execute the creative tasks at hand such as writing, coding, or any form of knowledge work. It&rsquo;s important that you&rsquo;re doing it because you really want to do it, not because you&rsquo;re under a lot of pressure from someone else. This is really about your exercise to &ldquo;just do it&rdquo;, without thinking of any barriers.</p>

        <p>Winter, spring, summer, or fall - I love bits and pieces of them. I love that on winter I can have a cool environment to sleep on. I hate winter, because it gets dark too early! I love spring because of the beautiful plants and flowers around, but I also hate it because of hay fever. I love summer because it&rsquo;s the best time to go to the beach and you have a lot of day time to spend outside business hours. I hate it when it&rsquo;s extremely hot and it causes bushfires! I love fall because when it&rsquo;s rainy, I get to concentrate with my work. For obvious reasons of rain, I don&rsquo;t want to see dried leaves that much (it looks sad). You see, you can&rsquo;t have everything. I tend to focus more on the advantages of each seasons, rather than complaining all the time.</p>

        <p>Community is a place where you find people with similar interests or profession. I&rsquo;ve been involved with the tech community for a decade now, and I still love meeting new people and talk about ideas, problems, and solutions about tech! I present to these community groups from time to time, and would continue doing it for the years to come. It&rsquo;s because of the community, that I get to progress in my career. I learned a lot from the people around and I also learned as part of sharing my knowledge and experience to them.</p>
<p>These days, it&rsquo;s all virtual and I didn&rsquo;t particularly like this medium. I&rsquo;m having the &ldquo;zoom fatigue&rdquo; effect lately, when all the interactions are abstracted into virtual communications. If the idea is to consume a resource or knowledge material, sure doing it virtual is appropriate - given you can skip and fast forward contents. But if we&rsquo;re looking at interactions and engagement, it&rsquo;s really hard to feel it these days with an online presence. I think this is the new normal, and the future would need to cater both in-person and virtual events. However, the spirit of community and knowledge sharing is this what matters.</p>
