        <p>Grief is one of the most difficult feeling in this world. This is probably the most painful emotional response to what&rsquo;s happening in your world. In my opinion, when this happens to you, it challenges all of your pre-conceived knowledge and beliefs in life. You question about everything: from science, philosophy, behaviour, religion, and so on. You get in to a dark place in a rabbit hole of questions. You contemplate about the meaning of life, and what is your purpose in this world. This is a moment when you reflect what is really important to you; who are the ones you should spend more time with. Some people choose to ignore this feeling while some cries and let go. What I&rsquo;ve learned so far from these experiences is that, it is important to grief and accept this feeling, but also take a more positive outlook in life moving forward. Cherish the memories you had with that someone, learn from it, evolve from it&hellip; slowly or in a pace that you see fit. You don&rsquo;t have to worry what others would say or comment on to you, grieving is a personal process that you have to go through. Take your time to process it, but understand that you need to figure out how to move forward from this.</p>

        <p>My brain works better when I think in pictures. This is probably why I thrive as a software engineer and architect. I can easily visualize data flows and business requirements; then translate them into something technical that we can implement. I have not really undergone any serious tests or evaluation, but I‚Äôm really at my best when I can visualize things.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs probably why I enjoy seeing architecture diagrams and love doing them too! I become so passionate about ‚Äúwell-architected‚Äù software and something that is well thought of. This does not apply to my work though, but all throughout various aspects of my life, like looking at my calendar, looking at my desk, arrangements for my furniture, reading data, and so forth.</p>
<p>Picture indeed says a thousand words. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not alone in this line of thought. There are others who are in the same space and approach as I do. I enjoy doing puzzles, and solving problems that are relevant and valuable. Think in pictures, you see the world through a clearer lens.</p>

        <p>Security is such a broad topic but is simple in principle. It‚Äôs about protecting something, either that is you, your family, or properties against unwanted scenarios. This applies to a lot of different domains such as in physical properties like your home and workplace, and as well as in your digital life, such as computers, software, banking systems, and so on.</p>
<p>Depending on which domain, there are also different levels and approaches to security. Most of the time, the security aspect of things are concentrated on people‚Äôs malicious intents. These intents are mostly around theft, privacy, and exploits. As we say, there is no perfect system. You can only protect what you know and currently understand. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to invest in it proactively.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, this space has developed because the different level of threats and techniques in breaking barriers are also growing. This is a never-ending cycle as things progress throughout the years. There will be more exploits or hacking that will happen, and more security standards and protocols will be applied. We will continuously learn from this cycle.</p>

        <p>When I was younger, I thought that you have an unlimited number of energy in a day. You can do school, play games, interact with friends &amp; family, do homework, and even dream about what‚Äôs going to happen tomorrow. I can still remember my young self, who has the bravado and burning passion that I can always do the extra mile.</p>
<p>Now that I‚Äôm an adult, I‚Äôve come to a realisation that your energy in a day is actually very limited. Especially now that all the information and instant pleasures/gratifications are within our reach, we become overwhelmed by where to spend this energy. Awareness of the limits of time is a good wisdom to have. I‚Äôve decided that I will always be selfish with where I put my time in. I should choose wisely where to put my energy on. Not all battles are worth fighting, not all dreams are worth pursuing, not all ideas are worth building, not all relationships are worth cultivating, because your time here is limited - so decide where to spend it wisely.</p>
<p>I still watch some anime here and there, but not as invested as I used to be. Right now, it‚Äôs just a general content I watch just to pass by the time or for me to fall asleep. Maybe in the future I‚Äôll go back to being hooked with Anime, but not right now.</p>

        <p>Anime has been a big part of my childhood. The young me have watched, read, and played various anime media content. I was so hooked on it back in the days. I‚Äôm always up to date with manga content of One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, and all the similar genres. It even helped me cope up with some ‚Äúteens‚Äù problem or, as you know it, the ‚Äúfinding your inner self‚Äù kind of thing. It‚Äôs also a cultural norm that me and my friends enjoyed across.</p>
<p>I think the big reason I liked it is that it‚Äôs still animated but not childish enough, like cartoons. There was actually a lot of immersive storyline and characters that made you feel like ‚Äúyou too.‚Äù In some regards, it‚Äôs also an escape to the reality. In anime, anything is possible. Back then, TV shows and movies weren‚Äôt ‚Äúsuper immersive‚Äù in terms of character development and animation that‚Äôs why Anime was really a hit for me. There is no limit on what the creator or artist can do, and no limitation on actors and actresses.</p>
<p>I still watch some anime here and there, but not as invested as I used to be. Right now, it‚Äôs just a general content I watch just to pass by the time or for me to fall asleep. Maybe in the future I‚Äôll go back to being hooked with Anime, but not right now.</p>

        <p>Coffee has been a big part of my life for the past decade. For obvious reasons like keeping me wake up at night doing some work, to making sure I‚Äôm well energized in the morning. There was a period in my life that I was probably close to drinking 6 shots a day, but I already gave up that lifestyle.</p>
<p>I have learned to tone down with it, because I already realized my limit on energy. Instead of pushing myself every night to go further, I focus on the most impactful activities instead of the day. I was in an illusion in the past that I have unlimited energy, motivation, and the passion will just keep me going. I‚Äôve had a lot of burn outs since then.</p>
<p>Now, I set a rule that I won‚Äôt be drinking any caffeinated drinks after 01:00 PM to make sure that I set my body up for resting at night. This transformation was hard, but I could do it through a series of habit exploration. I am drinking more water now and occasionally replacing coffee with tea at night or in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I believe that coffee is amazing and I won‚Äôt ever giving up on it, unlike alcohol that I‚Äôm already having a distant relationship with. But all things should come with moderation.</p>

        <p>Organising my calendar has been my system since I was in college. It means a lot to me when I know that it‚Äôs in my outlook calendar. It‚Äôs like saying you‚Äôre going to credit a portion of your life to do something at that specific point in time. This allows me to plan and prioritise ahead on what‚Äôs really important.</p>
<p>Right now, I have around 5 calendars: 1 for Personal &amp; Family event, 1 for health like running schedules and meal plans, 1 for my consulting business, 1 for my startup venture, and the other 1 for my long-term contract client. It‚Äôs nice to have modern technologies that allow you to visualise things clearly or as we say it ‚Äúat a glance.‚Äù</p>
<p>These days, I make sure that I plan for the week. I do this planning on Sundays. If I need time to ‚Äúcode‚Äù or build something, I schedule it. I don‚Äôt do it from the little tiny window of non-meetings throughout the day. If something is important to you, book it in your calendar!</p>
