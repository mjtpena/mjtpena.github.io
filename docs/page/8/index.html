        <p>Don‚Äôt chase success, aim progress. It took me a while to get it, but that‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt feel excited or joyous anymore after achieving or hitting a milestone. The actual gold is the process and the experience that you get as part of achieving micro-goals. As we keep on saying, it‚Äôs about the journey and not the destination.</p>
<p>The problem I faced back in the day is that I thought I will just randomly feel the ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù hit or light bulb moment to be inspired to do something really special. What actually happens is the opposite. When I have to work hard on to something and I have to do small increments on a daily or weekly basis, that‚Äôs when I deliver more impact. It‚Äôs about those battles that make you a hero, not winning the war.</p>
<p>The best lesson I‚Äôve learned so far in life is that In order to be successful, you really just have to enjoy the long and boring process. Improve each day. Learn new things each day. Make better decisions each day. The person who can call themselves successful are not the rabbits who chased the carrot and will starve tomorrow, but the eagles who keep flying and hunting, every single day.</p>

        <p>I like sunsets. It means a lot to me metaphorically. Romantically, I enjoyed seeing sunsets with my wife. There was this one time at a beach in the Philippines when we were riding a boat and we just looked at how beautiful the sunset was. That day is something I won‚Äôt ever forget.</p>
<p>The transition of day and night is fascinating because it gives you a clear boundary that you need to ‚Äúchange a state‚Äù from one to another. Whether that‚Äôs school/work and you have to go home. This could also mean that things are about to shut down now, and you have few more hours left for the day.</p>
<p>When it‚Äôs nighttime, it‚Äôs usually a moment to reflect to end the day and do things that are more relaxed and more intimate with the surrounding people. It‚Äôs a flip from doing day jobs into being with your family again. Obviously, across the day, I get pockets of time with my family that I reflect on and cherish as well.</p>

        <p>Terminals, shells, and CLIs are some of the recent things that I keep tinkering about. I like to make them colourful, using a lot of plugins to automate my typings, and all the goodness of just executing commands.</p>
<p>Back then, I was a GUI (Graphical User Interface) person, but I just found that for some advanced scenarios; I have to really use the command line to execute advanced commands or scripts. I found the experience hard at first, but after a while, it has been a friendly and smooth ride.</p>
<p>I would still use a mix of GUI and CLI for different workflows. I won‚Äôt be a purist on one option, as I know that there are advantages to choose one from the other. However, I‚Äôm pretty sure that even when the technology progresses in a decade, we will still use a form factor of a terminal.</p>

        <p>Microsoft has been a big part of my career even until today. I don‚Äôt even know where to start my Microsoft journey. Maybe when I was a kid using a Windows PC Pentium 1? It was really when until I was around 17 when I got hooked because of being part of the [[Microsoft Student Partners]] program and got exposed to many people that I really liked. Obviously, there were also some inspirations with Bill Gates and Satya Nadella at my end.</p>
<p>I had my internship in Microsoft when I was a teenager. In my professional career, I have worked with a bunch of Microsoft focused consulting companies. I even started companies that are focused on them. I am a Microsoft MVP. I talk and share a lot about Microsoft technologies. I‚Äôve also worked a lot with Microsoft people in APAC and ANZ. It‚Äôs all a small world for me right now. The Microsoft space is so wide that there are just so many product groups and people involved.</p>
<p>The only thing I haven‚Äôt done is to work there as a full-time employee. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the right fit right now. I am happy being from the outside but leveraging the partnerships and knowledge that I got. I enjoy working with the people in there, but not yet really looking into working inside. Time will tell.</p>

        <p>The first thing that I do when I wake up is to think of ‚Äúthat one thing‚Äù for the day. This ceremony has been embodied for me since I was young. I actually can‚Äôt remember who thought me about it, or if I got it from someone. It‚Äôs probably a product of laziness and procrastination, that I‚Äôll just sleep on things and whatever I think about tomorrow will be the one I‚Äôll be doing.</p>
<p>It helped me a lot, as this allowed me to focus on ‚Äúthat one thing‚Äù early in the morning. This allows me to have a hard stop on something and feel accomplished and satisfied already for the day in terms of work. Anything else after that is spent on the family or something I can do without pouring a lot of energy and passion.</p>
<p>Obviously, on some days, I wasn‚Äôt able to accomplish ‚Äúthat one thing‚Äù for a lot of reasons. But I think 5/7 in a week, I get it done. I would continue practicing this. This has helped me stay on track with my career trajectory and financial goals as well. As I keep on saying, you can do anything, but not everything. It‚Äôs important to understand that in the finite life that you have, you spend it on meaningful things that matter - with focus.</p>

        <p>I would say that one of the best things that change in my character is how I can remain calm despite of stress and general disappointments in life. I realized it is so tiring to be angry with something if you know that it‚Äôs not really a battle worth fighting. I realized that you only have limited time in this world, and I don‚Äôt want to be live and be remembered as someone who is angry all the time.</p>
<p>On a day-to-day basis, I experience a lot of problems at work, my relationship, and general happenings as part of the pandemic. I want to stay calm when I can. When times get tough and rage is feeling up my nerves, I go to a safe place or channel (such as writing) to put on those negative emotions. I think, therefore, exercises and meditation would really help a lot with these kinds of things. I don‚Äôt want to be very rushed with decisions. Keep calm, think through it, then execute once you‚Äôre in a better thought process.</p>

        <p>I consider myself as a self-managed individual in terms of career and lifestyle. It occurred to me I don‚Äôt want anyone to manage ‚Äúme‚Äù personally in order to perform tasks and deliver results. This is not to be confused about having a project manager or coordinators I work with - most of them are outstanding. What I‚Äôm talking about are those who want to tell me how I should work or what I need to do. I have unlocked the side of my brain to think creatively and logically to align with business goals.</p>
<p>To an extent, I am also a project manager and coordinator. I give people technical directions about capabilities and what can be done. There are a lot of things to look at in terms of deliverables in a project, and communication is key. I would argue that I am an excellent communicator and I can deliver outstanding technical results too. What I lack right now are the sales chops to do the actual sales pitch and sell business commercials. That is something I am still learning and working on right now.</p>
<p>On an ideal day, I spend a portion of my morning and night time doing ‚Äúdeep technical work‚Äù like getting my hands dirty with coding and architecture diagrams. In the afternoon, I attend meetings and talk to people to collaborate; sometimes I also present. Then late afternoon to night time is family time. That is a good balance that works for me right now.</p>
