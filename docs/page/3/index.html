        <p>This past few months with the pandemic and lockdown, I haven&rsquo;t had a good chance of fixing my hairstyle. I stopped caring about it couple of years ago. From what people have told me, I look best and presentable when I have a shorter hair.</p>
<p>However there is a bigger symbolic reference of haircut on my end. It&rsquo;s about taking off some of the accumulated baggages that I had for the past few months in order to take more load eventually. I also feel, in general, that I am a little light headed or less stressed by having a short haircut. This is all placebo, I know.</p>
<p>Often because we&rsquo;re so busy from our work, relationships, and hobbies that we tend to forget personal care. Although this is subjective from person to person, but the concept of brushing your hair, or taking care of your skin, and anything cosmetic; it&rsquo;s good to take care of yourself once in a while. This is a form of break that you can do so that you&rsquo;ll have a time &ldquo;just for yourself&rdquo; which is again a good thing.</p>

        <p>Taking a nap is something I often forget these past few months because of working from home. I am a serial napper. I am notorious to take a nap anywhere. Even on 5 to 10 minute bus rides, I can still take a micro nap.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why I am so energetic both at work and at home before pandemic. I use the pocket of times to either do something that interests me or take this time for a nap. Given that I don&rsquo;t commute these past few days, I am just in the constant treadmill of work, notifications, and actions that I often forget to take a rest.</p>
<p>I would probably schedule naps in the afternoon so that I can be recharged for the night time when I&rsquo;m with the family. It&rsquo;s really about the quality of rest that we have. It was never about how long you sleep. I do remember time and time again, that my whole inspiration to do great work is so that I can take a good rest knowing that I&rsquo;ve done something.</p>

        <p>Love is effortful and attentive. It&rsquo;s a good disturbance in our lives. It is a continuous process that we develop on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s about giving the best quality time despite having limited free time because of all the work and ventures that you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s about the constant reminder of what really matters.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just say you love someone (or something) without putting the attention and effort on making it better. It&rsquo;s more around how you can cultivate those seeds in to something meaningful not just for yourself. Love is tiring and exhausting, but it&rsquo;s a good kind of restlessness. It means that you&rsquo;re actively working on it, you keep pouring in your effort and attention to it.</p>
<p>Love matters.</p>

        <p>In order to be successful, you have to do things differently from others. The key words are &ldquo;do&rdquo; and &ldquo;different&rdquo;; and both of them needs to be present. It&rsquo;s not enough to just &ldquo;be different&rdquo; - like you&rsquo;re different from others because of your background, personality, or skills. It&rsquo;s about applying actions on those different ideas. It&rsquo;s about trying to think outside the box, but also working on testing if the idea is viable.</p>
<p>Doing things different will make your odds higher than not doing it nor doing it just like everyone else. In this ever connected world of social media, internet, and mobile phones. In order to thrive, you have to create content that are uniquely different - something that establishes your brand. Success is inevitable once you put on the effort and constant iterations on it.</p>
<p>Do something different today, and you might propel yourself for future success!</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s the political season again in the Philippines and my whole network back there are all over places expressing their opinions and political views. At this point, I don&rsquo;t really have much to say about it, and I don&rsquo;t have the right mindset and priorities to be in it. I have other set of problems and deliverables to deal with. I have business ventures to run, and ideas that needs to be polished, tested, and executed.</p>
<p>As part of this, I would like to spend less time in the next couple of weeks on Social Media as a consumer. I&rsquo;d be solely using my social accounts as a content creator and posting using marketing tools. As usual, the problem that I have with social media is that when I don&rsquo;t interact with it, then it just becomes a COG machine that gets funneled in my head without me really getting much out of it.</p>

        <p>Investing is better than saving. But saving is way better than spending so much. Investing is a means of earning more money by using your existing money as an instrument. Again, money begets money.</p>
<p>My general rule in life is that whatever it takes, yield at least 6% more each year. This is just a guidance that you should earn at least 6% more to beat the inflation. Your money, if just sitting on the bank, will depreciate.</p>
<p>I would consider that I&rsquo;m lucky (not really that smart) because of some investments that I yielded into a lot for the past years. I would live as frugal as I can and earn as much as possible.</p>

        <p>There are so many topics you can talk about in life. There are things that are easily relatable to your actual experience, then there are those that are more abstract, some are just really so random.</p>
<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re writing or researching, you just have to define who is it for? Maybe it&rsquo;s for you, maybe it&rsquo;s for someone else, or maybe no one really has to know. The audience is really for you to work on later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing for the past 2 years, in order to be more organized with my thoughts and memories. I tend to just trust my brain in the past that I would be able to remember everything. I also thought that I can just contain all the ideas and emotions inside me. Obviously, I was wrong.</p>
<p>So whatever it takes, think of a topic you can talk or write about. Whether it&rsquo;s in &ldquo;draft&rdquo; or something you won&rsquo;t end up using to an article or blog, that&rsquo;s fine. What&rsquo;s important is that you are dedicated with whatever you wanted to do. Don&rsquo;t let these topics and thoughts to just stay in your head. Let loose, and put that into a content that can be consumed later on.</p>
