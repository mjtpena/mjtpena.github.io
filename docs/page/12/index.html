        <p>Organising my calendar has been my system since I was in college. It means a lot to me when I know that it‚Äôs in my outlook calendar. It‚Äôs like saying you‚Äôre going to credit a portion of your life to do something at that specific point in time. This allows me to plan and prioritise ahead on what‚Äôs really important.</p>
<p>Right now, I have around 5 calendars: 1 for Personal &amp; Family event, 1 for health like running schedules and meal plans, 1 for my consulting business, 1 for my startup venture, and the other 1 for my long-term contract client. It‚Äôs nice to have modern technologies that allow you to visualise things clearly or as we say it ‚Äúat a glance.‚Äù</p>
<p>These days, I make sure that I plan for the week. I do this planning on Sundays. If I need time to ‚Äúcode‚Äù or build something, I schedule it. I don‚Äôt do it from the little tiny window of non-meetings throughout the day. If something is important to you, book it in your calendar!</p>

        <p>Having a clean desk is something I aspire to every now and then. I‚Äôve been trying to find different ways to have an optimise working environment for my creative and logical output (programming and presenting). When my desk is clean and in order, that‚Äôs when I get to have a lot of things done. The less I see, the more output I provide.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why these days, when I don‚Äôt need something, I put it in my bad. Those mobile devices for testing? In my bad. Wallet, glasses, gift cards, keys, chargers, coins, and what not - all in my bag. And when I need them, I attempt to pick them up again. If it‚Äôs not something that you need, better if it‚Äôs not around you. That is my definition of clean. Dusts are fine and inks, but clean means nothing that distracts you.</p>
<p>I aspire to have a lot of things done in a day, and having a clean desk is a way to set up my environment for success. Just like having the right specifications for a car, the journey will be great. However, other days are not perfect as I get distracted or I am in a state of flow that I don‚Äôt notice them at all. Well, in retrospect, that‚Äôs actually a good thing.</p>
<p>So clean desk is an environment that lets me be focused and in flow.</p>

        In the past, I&rsquo;ve been using my Macbook Pro to do all things blockchain and smart contracts development. One of the hurdles I encountered in the past is that some tooling and frameworks were not first class citizens on Windows.

        <p>Watching movies is my hobby. It‚Äôs been like that since I was young. I think it all began when I was so fascinated with advanced graphic designs of things. The likes of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are just so immersive during those times that I really felt the action and depth of the stories. I‚Äôve probably watched like a lot of movies. Back when cinemas were still a thing, I would always like to watch expected movies on its first week of release. There is just so much excitement at having to watch those films and immerse to the story.</p>
<p>In my college years until now, the franchise of Marvel Cinematic Universe and the whole superhero genre occupied everyone‚Äôs attention. There is just so much to explore and so much you can think of. I‚Äôve watched movies with my family, my friends, and pretty much everyone. It‚Äôs a culture that I think almost anywhere in the world, people do.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs now something I do and share the experience with my wife. We watch movies and actually immerse to the story line and plot. We want to watch something together that both of us can actually enjoy. Good thing, she‚Äôs also in to action and fantasy movies! I watch many movies, including drama and thrillers. The only regret that I wish I did when I watched movies back then was to write a reaction to it. Even a sentence or two should be enough.</p>

        <p>Losing weight is actually very simple. You‚Äôll literally just have to eat less. It‚Äôs that simple. Then, of course, losing weight does not really equate to being healthy. You can lose weight by cutting a lot of sugar and carbs in few weeks or months, then eventually succumb back to old habits. Well, you‚Äôve achieved your goal of ‚Äúlosing weight‚Äù, but you see&hellip; you didn‚Äôt develop a lifestyle of being healthy.</p>
<p>Being healthy means a lot of things. There is the weight aspect of it that relates to chronic diseases like diabetes and heart failures. There are also factors like stress and genetics that directly contribute to your health. To put it simply, it‚Äôs like playing ‚Äúwhack a mole‚Äù when you say that you want to be healthy. My opinion on this right now is to follow a routine or system that allows you to be consistent with your eating habits, exercises, and athletic goals.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt follow a lot of sports and athleticism culture. I adore though people who are focused and have developed good habits about their health system. Those who have a good balance of what really matters on them. I think a true measurement of a healthy person is on how much they are fulfilling their relative potential by following systems and routines that enable those outcomes.</p>

        <p>Planning an event is both fun and frustrating at the same time. It&rsquo;s fun because you get to do something that is servicing for others (such as a community or group of people). There are so many thing that you can learn in the process from understanding different people&rsquo;s perspectives and likeness, to the variety of topics, to understanding the current industry trends, and the list goes on. It is sometimes frustrating because there are just too many unknowns before, during, and after the events. The ability to adapt and execute is key for a successful event planning. Of course no event will ever be &ldquo;super perfect&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s the overall outcome that matters. I think overall, it&rsquo;s about the value of what you&rsquo;ll gain in experience should justify the effort that you are going to exert for it. And of course, it&rsquo;s not just about you you you. It&rsquo;s about them them them.</p>

        <p>There are so many things you can talk about, friendship. I would like to focus on the benefits and the positive side of it, rather than the downside. There are reasons you would want to have friends or be friend with someone. Well, for one, we survived as species by having a collection of like-minded people - aka tribes. Although not all the members of the tribe can be your friend, you accept someone else to be part of your life - and vice versa.</p>
<p>I think the essence of friendship is to be more than yourself. It‚Äôs the acknowledgement from within that you‚Äôre not alone in this world, and world doesn‚Äôt revolve just around you. Having friends means sharing some common interests, goals, passions, and many more. Sometimes friendship is simply just because you understand each other - no questions asked.</p>
<p>The superb ones are those who stick with you unconditionally and will be in the test of time. It‚Äôs not bounded by a contract, work, or any selfish act that both parties should benefit. As we keep on saying, giving more, we get more - that is really true in real and genuine friendship. In your life, it‚Äôs about the company and experiences that you share with those people, rather than what they can really offer to you. That is friendship.</p>
