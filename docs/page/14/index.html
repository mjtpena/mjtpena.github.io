        <p>Practice makes perfect. Maybe not &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; for everyone, but close to the objective or your goal. It takes a lot of repetition to truly master a craft or a profession, you need to spend a lot of those hours in order to learn what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work. For most of the time, practicing is a mental game of repetition in order to really &ldquo;nail it.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t just be an expert to a specific topic overnight. You can have an opinion about it, but not an expert. It&rsquo;s those repeated failures and struggles that will emerge you as an expert to that topic or practice.</p>

        <p>Building a house is not easy. There are so many things involved and it can get complicated and complex really quick. There are just so many things to consider such as the price, design, and a lot of other things. It&rsquo;s a process that you have to undergo if you want to really become invested emotionally to the property that you&rsquo;re building. It takes a lot of sleepless nights and divided attention, not to mention the anxiety that this brings on your head. So if you think you want to build a house, have a think again.</p>

        <p>Weekends are very important to me now. Back then, I treat it as a way to do more work while others are busy with their personal lives. That was so wrong in so many levels. For one, you need the actual rest so that you&rsquo;ll have the energy and motivation for the week ahead. Another thing is that, it&rsquo;s also the time to do things that you don&rsquo;t normally do during work time. This includes doing side projects, exploring new hobbies, and making memories with your family and friends. At the end of the week, it&rsquo;s really what matters that count, not the amount of $$$ that you have.</p>

        <p>Joining or starting a start-up is not as simple as it could be. There are a lot of complexity involved. From finding and partnering with the right set of people, to creating and building the actual product. This is a very competitive space and would require a lot of energy, passion, and attention. Unlike a side-project that you can just run, a startup requires focus and product market fit. If you have the time, energy, and resources I would advise for you t o give it a try. If you&rsquo;re only going to do it half-heartedly, then it&rsquo;s best not to proceed.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m particularly liking the Markdown format in creating notes. Thanks to [[RoamResearch]] and [[Hugo]] (with the whole JAMstack craze), I am being sucked in this cult. I am actually realizing the benefits as I have more structure on my thoughts and flow of information. I follow a format that would work to most systems these days, and it&rsquo;s easy to convert and transpose anywhere.</p>
<p>I am still learning some of the advanced capabilities of Markdown. But so far the basic indenting, header, attaching of images are more than enough to get the hook of it. In the future, I would probably be looking at advanced formatting and positioning of texts / images. Also, I am also king [[Marp]] as a tool to convert Markdowns to PDF or PPT.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s fun recording podcasts episode as this is a way for me to learn (or refresh) on topics with a different perspective. It is also an interactive way for me to meet and know more about the person. These days, [[Bryan Anthony Garcia]] and I are doing [[The Battle of Clouds]] and it&rsquo;s a good way to immortalize topics. We give it a twist in a way that it&rsquo;s catered to young Filipino audience.</p>

        <p>Overwhelmed. I think that&rsquo;s a state when you have a lot of things in your mind and you&rsquo;re fighting an internal battle on how to deal with your problems. Sometimes the answers are not very clear and you don&rsquo;t have the answers right away. To overcome this state, you have to stop what you&rsquo;re doing and try to look from a far. You have to re-organize your thoughts on what&rsquo;s really important and what&rsquo;s urgent. In the grand scheme of things, all the items in your head are just flow of information that changes state and needs further processing. So stop. Re-think. Attack again.</p>
