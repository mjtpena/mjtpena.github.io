        <p>Waking up at the wrong side of the bed. That is a classic saying when it&rsquo;s early in the morning and people around you notices that you&rsquo;re not in the best mood as they observe your face. There are days when you wake up feeling sour and unproductive. You don&rsquo;t feel like doing something productive like working on your goals, writing &amp; journaling, or anything that requires a certain amount of effort to move.</p>
<p>The key is to move and get started somewhere. Just do even the tiniest progress you can do for the goals that you&rsquo;re setting. Once you&rsquo;ve propelled yourself to move, the power of inertia kicks in and will get the ball rolling on your mind and body. It&rsquo;s weird, but that&rsquo;s just how our body works. There isn&rsquo;t any magic on being motivated, you&rsquo;ll just have to do the hard work as part of the process.</p>
<p>Know that the difference between a good and bad day (in your perspective) is something only you can control. It is how you react on certain events and movements. It&rsquo;s how you plan your actions and focus on what you want to do. So get out there and start moving, you just need that first tiny step of action.</p>

        <p>The concept of time zones are amazing and funny at the same time. It&rsquo;s interesting to know that the other side of the world would be sleeping while you&rsquo;re awake. The weather differences are also interesting concepts. In this world where you can never have enough hours in a day, where you spend those times are increasingly becoming challenging.</p>
<p>In this &ldquo;very connected&rdquo; world, it&rsquo;s now hard to find the optimal time to work with peers all over the world. Things are also increasingly becoming asynchronous because of the work that we&rsquo;re doing are &ldquo;never done.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just changing from one state to the other, and someone else will just pick it up where you left of.</p>
<p>I think in the future, even environments can be simulated and you can choose your own setting or pace depending on your mood and preference. You can literally live the same environment and &ldquo;time&rdquo; on the other side of the globe while physically not being there. The concept is fascinating and scary at the same time. Time will tell.</p>

        <p>Server networking and maintenance are the things I didn&rsquo;t particularly like when I was younger. I really did like programming, coding, and general solutions architecture but I never really liked getting my hands dirty with server operations. Inevitably, it&rsquo;s one of those things in life that you must have no matter what when working on a solution.</p>
<p>I actually ended up being good at it. I&rsquo;m now maintaining couple of dozen of servers, infrastructure pipeline, containers &amp; kubernetes, and different network security groups. I&rsquo;ve actually seen the benefits of having a robust infrastructure and being the person who executes and maintains them. There is a spike of dophamine when you get things in order and balanced.`</p>
<p>I guess, in life you&rsquo;ll just have to be open-minded and always encourage new learnings and information as you learn them. Never &ldquo;hate&rdquo; a topic or curse it, because it will one way or the other find its way back to you. Learn to be &ldquo;antifragile&rdquo; with all these chaos of information and knowledge all around you. A wise person will find a way to make use of any knowledge he/she has.</p>
<p>Be a lifelong learner.</p>

        <p>A productive and &ldquo;good&rdquo; day can be ruined almost instantly before the day ends. It&rsquo;s very important to set the night right in order for the next day to be meaningful and well energised. I find it troublesome to deal with if I have issues from the night before such as family and work problems. It bothers me a lot, even on the next day. This feeling is just soul crashing as if you&rsquo;re not really in control of your own emotions and body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard when you have to conform with your own opinions and personality about a topic that bothers you versus applying certain mental models that can solve that specific problem. You&rsquo;ll be in conflict as if there are multiple personalities living inside you. When this happens, I think the best course of action is &ldquo;movement&rdquo; and just keep doing your routines. Get your shit together first by being in motion, then figure out how to deal with these as you go along. Maybe it&rsquo;s just as simple as talking about it with someone, maybe it&rsquo;s all in your head, maybe it will fade away soon.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, just keep going, my friend. What you&rsquo;re feeling is normal, and life still goes on.</p>

        <p>Retirement is a topic that I haven&rsquo;t really figured out that much yet. I just know two fundamental things that would apply to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>I need to set up a goal in terms of age or years where I should be &ldquo;financially&rdquo; independent.</li>
<li>I need to find other things to do that are meaningful come that time.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the first topic of financial independence. What that means is that I don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;work&rdquo; in order to live like getting food or shelter. Of course you can really never be certain in life, as there might be some emergencies that will emerge as part of it. I would just like to make sure that there isn&rsquo;t that &ldquo;financial hardship.&rdquo; However, there&rsquo;s also a balance of expecting what type of lifestyle can you really have at that point in time.</p>
<p>The second one comes in to doing things that you still love, but doesn&rsquo;t really translate into work that are outside of your ideals. This is probably a harder one. If you&rsquo;ve spent decades of your life in to something, then it&rsquo;s gonna be tough to pivot in to something else. On top of my mind right now, I want to be a full time househusband who enjoys spending time at home improvements and family.</p>

        <p>Plants, plants, plants - and more plants. My wife is really into plants and I support her on to that one. We probably have a hundred plants right now at home, and that&rsquo;s alright. I let her have that hobby and ownership of these cute little (and not so little) objects in our house. There will never be enough plants in our lives. They actually give good aesthetics to our place and makes it more breathable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things that I&rsquo;ve just developed an appreciation of but not really willing to commit on working / maintaining it. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m already busy or have a hundred things I&rsquo;d rather do, but it&rsquo;s just something that I didn&rsquo;t really like doing. The process is very important in order to have meaningful outcome, and I don&rsquo;t like the process of cultivating plants. I&rsquo;m a supportive husband in a way that I don&rsquo;t mind having &ldquo;a lot of it&rdquo; and willing to drive her distances just to have the right ones.</p>

        <p>I like planning for the week ahead. It&rsquo;s something I realised that is so effective in my line of work. If I don&rsquo;t plan my schedule well, I will just be reactive of things and won&rsquo;t have any focus. This usually leads to not being productive and a lot of demotivation. Although in the ideal world, things won&rsquo;t go wrong and your schedule will just work - obviously that&rsquo;s not the reality. It&rsquo;s probably a balance of trying to achieve at least 80% of what you planned and sacrificing 20% that are not really that much of a priority to you. I spend an hour or two of my weekend just to reflect on the past week, and plan for the week ahead.</p>
<p>On a high level, I like having 1 to 3 key deliverables for a day and will only work on that one, the rest are just &ldquo;burners&rdquo; or extras. Ideally in a day, the things that I really like doing, I should have finished them in the morning so that the rest of the afternoon and night are spent on things that are more geared towards your interests such as family time, hobbies, and other not so heavy mental work.</p>
