        <p>How much is your time? That is the question you should always ask yourself. Over and over again, we have to know that the most valuable resource in this planet is your time and attention. It&rsquo;s not just about the title or the money that you have, although they can be really useful instruments for your means but it&rsquo;s not the ultimate resource.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of life is to find ways to actually make good use of those time. In an ideal world, we&rsquo;re 100% productive and won&rsquo;t be even spending the slightest millisecond on things that doesn&rsquo;t really contribute to your improvement (or the whole world for that matter.)</p>
<p>Value your time, as that&rsquo;s the only thing that you hold dear and can really control in life. Your decisions, your actions, your reactions, those are the things that are within the bound of your conscious decisions. Stay focused on where you want to spend your time. Don&rsquo;t get distracted from shiny things that you see from others. Don&rsquo;t get distracted from what others think - fuck what they think. Think of what you really want - for you and the people you hold dear.</p>

        <p>Never go to autopilot. This is a state when you&rsquo;re just trying to live the day, expecting a better tomorrow. I have to keep reminding myself from time to time if what I&rsquo;m doing is something that is within my ideals and interests, or I&rsquo;m just riding someone&rsquo;s (or something) wave. This is a life-long struggle as we know more about ourselves and what our &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; is.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard because there are some aspects of your life, like chores and work meetings, to be just &ldquo;BAU&rdquo; or business as usual. For as long as they constitutes to the greater goal or the bigger thing such as earning X amount of money - they are never wrong. What&rsquo;s wrong is that, if you&rsquo;re blindsided in doing something without understanding &ldquo;why&rdquo; you&rsquo;re doing it. Take control of your life, the world needs more &ldquo;doers&rdquo; than followers.</p>

        <p>Keep producing no matter how hard it gets. As a creative worker who is a programmer &amp; software architect, a business owner, a startup advisor, a writer, an amateur content creator, and a lot more; they all revolve in the digital realm of &ldquo;you must produce something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing I make sure I do everyday is I journal all my thoughts and significant events throughout the day. I always make sure I write for at least 15 minutes, every single day - even if I&rsquo;m not in the mood or it&rsquo;s a terrible day at work. I am committed to the process, not just seeking the outcome.</p>
<p>You will be measured by how much you get consistent on the things you are really passionate about. There is no such thing as waiting for motivation to strike, progress will just keep you going. Keep creating content, keep writing code, keep researching for the next startup unicorn, keep analysing business problems, only then you will find success.</p>

        <p>Ideas are cheap. As a noun, it means nothing but a reference to something that could be great. It&rsquo;s just an abstract concept that doesn&rsquo;t have any tangible way for either you or others to experience.</p>
<p>In order for ideas to mean something, it needs to transition from a noun to a verb (action) because by only putting the work and process on to it, that&rsquo;s when value comes in. Only then, the idea becomes a product, a service, an outcome - and eventually turn in to business, profit, and purpose.</p>
<p>Ideas that stay as noun, in time will be regrets. &ldquo;I had that idea long ago&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;I thought about that&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;If only I did that&hellip;&rdquo;
If you are really wedded to your idea, go do something about it. If not, move on&hellip;</p>

        <p>Money is just an instrument. It&rsquo;s a means to get or achieve something. It&rsquo;s not the reason to live nor should be the cause of break-ups and damaging relationships. We all need money in order to at least get the minimum requirements to live: shelter, food, health, and safety. Anything beyond that is on the &ldquo;wants&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s subjective person to person.</p>
<p>I am at peace of the money that I have and the money that I will own in the future. I am on track to be wealthy by having the right disciplines, principles, and investments in place. I don&rsquo;t want to live by the day just to earn more money, I want to have enough money so that I don&rsquo;t have to work on other things that I don&rsquo;t particularly like.</p>
<p>I want to be in control of my time, which is the most valuable resource. Money is just a means to save time and effort on things that doesn&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>

        <p>There is so much happening in the NFT space right now, it&rsquo;s so interesting, fascinating, and intimidating at the same time. While most of my circles are still stuck in to the enterprise applications and the more traditional web &amp; mobile applications, a select people are changing the world by storm. There is a little fear of missing out on my end, but for me that&rsquo;s really adding some spice to this universe. It&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>At this point, I have at least 3 involvements in this game. Instead of just watching or investing on the side, I am building things that might turn to actual products and profit. I am happy to really pour in my time to this. I can&rsquo;t get distracted right now with other naysayers and things. I think it&rsquo;s time to really focus up my game on this. Less time on social media as a consumer, but more time as a producer and builder.</p>

        <p>Newsletters are fun. It&rsquo;s a way to consume information that are specific for an audience. I actually subscribe to a bunch of them. It&rsquo;s my way of getting updated on a topic that interests me, but at the same time, still curated and fact-checked by someone smarter than me in that field.</p>
<p>In the increasingly connected world of social media, we tend to find content that are more fitted to our needs and interests. There is just so much information happening around, and we just don&rsquo;t have enough time and effort to consume all of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started a newsletter for my son, in order to inform different member of the groups about his updates and what&rsquo;s happening around him. I found it intuitive and interesting enough that made me do it more than just for the numbers. What I&rsquo;ve learned is that content is king, the medium or platform is just secondary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have much interest in creating my own newsletter yet, as I am still finding my niche in this game. I am considering to really go back to the world of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, as this topic keeps pulling me back and back again.</p>
