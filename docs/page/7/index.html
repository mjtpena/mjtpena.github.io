        <p>I like waking up early in the morning when everything is still quiet and calm. The sunrise gives me a feeling of warmth that radiates energy for the day ahead. This is a ceremony that it&rsquo;s really a new day ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now re-developing a habit of waking up early again (sometime between 5:00 to 7:00 AM). Whenever I set myself for a successful morning, I know that I&rsquo;ll stick to the routine all throughout the day. It&rsquo;s about consistency and making things &ldquo;easy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If executed well, it&rsquo;s also the best time to learn something new or do challenging &ldquo;deep work tasks&rdquo;. The reason why I want to work on this routine again, is because comes 9:00 AM onwards, it&rsquo;s pure chaos of calls and unexpected things again (a separate mental model to apply). I want to make sure that I own the day ahead and be in control!</p>

        <p>You don’t wake up thinking “What should I do today?” For sure, you know what you want to do, you know what you “need” to do. You know what will give you that 1% progress in your career goals, habits, and spiritual wellbeing.</p>
<p>You should instead wake up saying “I will do this.” I want to do this “because.” When you convince yourself that you will commit to the action, it propels to getting things done. When things get done, that’s when you see progress. And continuous progress will lead to eventual “success.”</p>
<p>And then you call it a day, you then sleep. Tomorrow, you do the same thing. Maybe you’ll be working on a different goal that time, maybe it’s the same boring task; whatever it is, you know you’re doing it towards success.</p>

        <p>Reading is the most immersive and informative way of understanding a topic or subject. Although this takes a lot of time and effort, especially when you’re just beginning with your journey as a reader, it will be a fun and fulfilling activity to take daily. There is so much you can learn everyday just by reading. It will help you a lot in your career if you learn “how to learn”; and reading effectively is one principle that you have to understand and practice too.</p>
<p>The problems that most people had is that they wanted “to read a book” and not “become a reader” and there is a big difference. Reading should be a lifestyle of choice, rather than a medium to consume just a specific topic. It’s unfortunate that less and fewer people are inclined in to reading, because of the abundance of short-lived social media contents. It takes a lot of time for an author to publish a book, with very little monetary return on their end. So consuming that content that took them months or even years of hard work is such an excellent investment on its own.</p>

        <p>12 hours of sleep. Wow, it’s been a while since I had that. I can’t really remember when was the last time that happened. It felt so good to be that energized and ready to become productive after a long, painful night of flu. I was alone in a comfortable bed mattress, it’s so quiet, and the weather &amp; temperature was just right. It’s seldom that this happens. No phone calls, no disturbances, no notifications, no nothing. That is indeed what makes me rich. I guess sleep is now the good measurement of how wealthy you really are.</p>
<p>The feeling was way better than having to watch late night movies or binge watching/playing something. Sleep is one of the best reward in this world. A good quality sleep lets you feel better all throughout. I should probably take more long hour of sleep once in a while.</p>

        <p>I believe vaccines will save many people. I believe in the science behind it. Back in high school, it fascinated me about how vaccines are actually formed. It gave me some conviction that science is absolute and hard solid facts - not an opinion on your head. It is defined by certain rules, theories, and peer-reviewed by multiple smart people.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think it’s necessary for it to be a state or country mandate. It should still up to the individual to decide whether he/she wants to get vaccinated. This becomes complex when we have to mix politics, economics, and science all together. They have different principles and agenda in mind. However, I believe they are all aligned (and should) around the general welfare and safety of the citizens.</p>
<p>I wonder when this pandemic will really end. Until then, I’ll make sure people around me are vaccinated, consistently wearing masks, and still following social distancing. It still uncertain times for us. It’s the right balance of making sense of this life while being trapped in a cage or bubble.</p>

        For the longest of time, I would consider myself as the lone wolf at work. Most days, I&rsquo;d rather stay alone and be in my world to get things done.

        <p>The workplace has transformed in the last 2 years because of the pandemic. There is now an emergence of concept around the type of work you do as a knowledge worker. There is synchronous and asynchronous work.</p>
<p>Synchronous work are the things when you have to be together and be in sync to do things together. These are usually held for workshops and meetings that there’s a clear contribution from everyone and a defined deadline to hit. This also applies to hackathons.</p>
<p>Asynchronous work is the type of workflow when people and teams don’t have to be at the same place at the same time to accomplish outcome. This is when you are waiting for various teams when they can deliver what they do, in order for you to move on with your tasks.</p>
<p>I do a fine balance between synchronous and asynchronous work as I find different projects and tasks have different tempo on it. However, there is a big difference between “multi-tasking” and just hitting checkpoints and moving on to the next tasks at hand.</p>
