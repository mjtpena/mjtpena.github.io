        <p>During the holidays, I was contemplating on what skills should I invest time on for 2021. As someone who is working in the technology field, there are a lot of exciting things to double-down on: from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and a plethora of technology trends. As I reflected on how my 2020 went in terms of career and lifestyle, I noticed that there is an area I really need to work on - my digital life.</p>
<p>I noticed that there are a lot of times I am in an &ldquo;auto-pilot&rdquo; mode from scrolling social media feeds, watching endless YouTube videos, and binging mediocre movies, and TV series. However, this concept falls not only within the &ldquo;distractions&rdquo; realm, but it also applies to the so-called &ldquo;productive&rdquo; realm. When working, I sometimes spend a lot of &ldquo;midnight oils&rdquo; just so I can finish things from the imaginary deadlines that I&rsquo;ve set. A lot of times, when I thought I&rsquo;m trying to solve a problem, I end up with a rabbit hole of other topics and discussions - I get sidetracked without me knowing it. This also applies to technical topics.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/jumpstory-download20210104-231305.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s silly and funny if you think about it if represented in a not-so-digital way. Imagine going in the car, you start the engine, but we set no destination; you&rsquo;ll just drive across the block and see if something fun amuses you. However, as part of strolling along the streets, you also witness some not so good things or probably a lot of boring things - may be a ratio of 1:100; for every good thing you see around, it comes with 100 unpleasant sights.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve read a lot of self-help books around this topic, in particular a lot focuses on &ldquo;Digital Minimalism&rdquo; wherein they ask you to uninstall apps, unsubscribe to things, etc. In my opinion, it doesn&rsquo;t work for everyone, at least it doesn&rsquo;t work for me. These digital technologies, platforms, and applications are part of my career and my lifestyle. One way or the other, I need App X and App Y. However, I don&rsquo;t need them ALL the time.</p>
<p>What I need is a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; so I have the right intention when I&rsquo;m about to use a device or application. I need to develop a mental model, framework, methodology so that even if I have over 10 devices, I can safeguard myself from the rabbit hole and infinity pool of contents. I think the right term for this is <strong>Digital Intentionality</strong>.</p>
<p>What I want to accomplish by the end of the year are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I will use my phone as a &ldquo;reaction-based&rdquo; device. Someone called me, let me call that person back. I need to show my ID, let me pull that app. I need to take a picture of that thing, pull it out. The need must come first, before I use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I open a laptop, I know what I need to do. I need to use the keyboard to write on something. Book a hotel. Read a book while taking notes. Learn new skills or technologies. Do whatever tasks I&rsquo;ve decided, then when I&rsquo;m done, close the laptop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I need to work on a more compute-intensive tasks, I use my desktop or remote server. After the task, shut it down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I want to play some games, either use my Xbox or my desktop. I won&rsquo;t be surfing the internet or fiddling with my phone while doing so. I&rsquo;ll be focusing on the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there is a good movie or TV Series to watch on, I&rsquo;ll be watching it with full intention. If it sucks after the 10% mark, abandon it. Same applies with books and audiobooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In situations where I need to wait while being outside, I pull out my Kindle or a physical book that I have and do some light reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And a lot more that will help me let the devices serve me, not the other way around.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>These technologies are here to stay, you can&rsquo;t just go rogue and live on the mountains. This is part of who we are now as a society, whether or not you like it. It&rsquo;s time that we make sure we are still in control of our lives, not some machine learning algorithms.</p>
