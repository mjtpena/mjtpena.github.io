<h3 id="-speech-therapy">🎙 Speech Therapy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Andriel is expanding his vocabulary. He is now getting trained on new words such as colours (yellow, red, blue) and animal names.</li>
<li>Andriel continuously use verbal communications to request and ask for help.</li>
<li>Andriel keeps hugging his mum and dad while saying “I yab you” (from ayayoo).</li>
<li>There are instances where Andriel is speaking Filipino (Tagalog) utterances despite us not communicating with him in that medium.</li>
<li>As he expands his vocabulary, he is also mixing words and getting confused from time to time. We’re working on this by making sure that Andriel should be confident on what to say, instead of “just guessing.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-psychologist--behaviour-therapy">🧠 Psychologist / Behaviour Therapy</h3>
<ul>
<li>We continue teaching Andriel on how to control his emotions (Angry / Happy / Sad).</li>
<li>These days there isn’t a lot of frustration (biting / scratching) compared before.</li>
<li>Andriel is improving in terms of recognising emotions of others around him (parents)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-occupational-therapy">🚴‍♀️ Occupational Therapy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Andriel is doing well in terms of sitting for a period of time to perform activities. We continue working on gross and fine motor skills.</li>
<li>We’re currently working on Andriel’s capability to further improve his focus and listening skills. We do this by “adding up” more steps to activities that he likes. For example: stepping on coloured tiles where he has to “stop” / “go” / “go to… Red”</li>
<li>His gross motor skills are improving further as he was able to carry heavier objects, close the doors properly, and climb even higher grounds.</li>
<li>We’re continuously working on his writing skills as part of school readiness. Right now, he can write in most directions (up / down / left / right) with minimal supervision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-schools">Pre-schools</h2>
<h3 id="-sdn-beranga-autism-specific">🌈 SDN Beranga (Autism Specific)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Andriel shows high interests in gross motor activities. He is very confident with his climbing skills that he would go up the monkey bars.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2022/05/20220507174854.png" alt="img"></p>
<ul>
<li>Andriel continues to explore various activities such as painting, play doughs, exploring food. For the next couple of months, all of these sit down “focus” plays are the focus for Andriel.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-papilio-ingleburn-mainstream">🦋 Papilio Ingleburn (Mainstream)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The educators’ observation is that Andriel always prefer to be alone. In the coming weeks and months, they will continue to encourage Andriel to join group activities.</li>
<li>He does listen to instructions such as going to the toilet / time to eat / go home.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2022/05/20220507174227.png" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="-primary-schools">🪜 Primary Schools</h2>
<ul>
<li>All documents are submitted to Austral Public School and we’ll just be waiting for further assessments / requirements.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, a lot of catholic schools doesn’t offer support classes; and they didn’t consider Andriel for a placement next year.</li>
<li>We’re still in the process of applying to Aspect Macarthur.</li>
<li>We missed the application for Mater Dei this year, but we’re on the wait list for openings this year or the next.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="home-and-family-activities">🏡Home and Family Activities</h1>
<h2 id="home-updates">Home Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toileting</strong>. He consistently didn’t have any accident in the past 2 weeks. There are also instances when Andriel prompts us that he wants to go to the toilet for a poop. Toileting is now part of his daily routine that he holds it off, until he gets to a toilet. Last night he wasn’t even wearing a nappy at sleep!</li>
<li><strong>Dentist</strong>. Andriel is scheduled to do his dental surgery this month. We’ll keep you posted on how it will go.</li>
<li><strong>Home Therapies</strong>. We continue to work with Andriel to improve his skills on all aspects. It is very evident that he is learning a lot these days, and you can see the effort from him as well. From iPad apps to sit down activities, Andriel shows improvement on a lot of things. Lately, he’ve mastered numeracy of “1 to 10”.</li>
<li><strong>Going out</strong>. Whenever we go out for either groceries or shopping, Andriel will always hold his dad’s hand. He is becoming aware of being supervised and would actually initiate holding hands whenever he is walking.</li>
<li><strong>Self awareness</strong>. I think Andriel is becoming more “self aware” about what’s happening around him. Whenever we play videos of him (like teaching him ABCs), he would look at it and he would also follow it. He is also very opinionated now whenever we ask him what he likes in terms of food, toys, and activities.</li>
