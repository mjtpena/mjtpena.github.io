        <p>Before 2018, I was never a book reader. Reading a book seems like a chore to me. I can barely finish a chapter. I always had that internal conflict (possibly based from childhood experience) that only &ldquo;the smart people&rdquo; can read books. Another factor is, I&rsquo;ve always associated books to &ldquo;school&rdquo; or &ldquo;academia&rdquo; that felt like an enclosed culture that didn&rsquo;t really synced in to me. Also, I&rsquo;d rather watch a film or TV series than read a 300 to 500 pager book - because of cinematics. It&rsquo;s a much more immersive experience than doing the effort of &ldquo;reading intentionally.&rdquo; Also, growing up maybe I just didn&rsquo;t find &ldquo;reading book&rdquo; as something cool amongst teenagers and the society I used to live.</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/jumpstory-download20210108-203724-1024x683.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read some more technical books (AKA glanced to relevant resources) but not really absorbing most of it - just like the textbooks I had in school. Around 2017, I&rsquo;m noticing that there has been a big decline of quality movies and TV shows, or maybe I just got burned out from it. It&rsquo;s hard for me to find unique (or interesting) movie plots or immersion beyond CGIs and occasional laughs.</p>
<p>It was 2018 when I decided to <code>really</code> read. I started from the familiar grounds of Software Engineering and Startups. I&rsquo;ve read most of the &ldquo;Top 10 must read books for Software Engineers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Top 10 books for Startup Founders&rdquo;, and those cliche lists. It was &ldquo;The Phoenix Project&rdquo; by Gene Kim that really made it a fun experience for me. It&rsquo;s a fiction novel that romanticise the horrors of IT operations and how they could thrive from it. I also enjoyed &ldquo;The Martian&rdquo; by Andy Weir and &ldquo;Read Player One&rdquo; by Ernest Cline. Since then, I&rsquo;ve probably read close to 100 books. The books I&rsquo;ve read in two years are actually more than the books I&rsquo;ve read in my first two decades since I learned to read.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight that for others we take book reading for granted, but in fact it&rsquo;s actually a privilege. I&rsquo;m fortunate enough at this point that I can simply buy a book either online or at a bookstore without really &ldquo;saving&rdquo; for it. The price of a Kindle device or buying spree $100 book bundles wouldn&rsquo;t hurt. Also, some books, I can expense in my business. My thinking is that, if it helps me one way or the other in the future, then I should buy it as an &ldquo;investment&rdquo; rather than an &ldquo;expense.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re privileged to buy a book or reading devices, do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a love-hate relationship with Kindle (the device) or actually any reading apps for a while now. Sometimes reading on Kindle doesn&rsquo;t work for me, and sometimes it does. I&rsquo;ll explain what works for me soon. I&rsquo;ve had 3 Kindle devices and probably attempted to install it to all my phones and tablets. I think in any form of habit that you&rsquo;re trying to cultivate, there is a certain level of learning curve and product-fitting on what works for you best.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-read-books">How I read books</h2>
<ul>
<li>As part of my journey to Digital Intentionality, I don&rsquo;t use my mobile phone anymore to read a book. Two major reasons are: Too much distractions; and I enjoy reading before I sleep - so bringing the phone in bed is a call for disaster.</li>
<li>I read a physical book when I can and when I want to read that book in that form. For some reasons, there are books that are superb to read physically because it immersed you with &ldquo;exclusivity&rdquo;. An example is reading the bible, I&rsquo;d rather open an actual bible than to read it from an app.</li>
<li>I read on my Kindle with a low-light setting before I sleep. Sometimes I fell asleep while reading, and would read again first thing in the morning.</li>
<li>I read on my Kindle if I know I have to wait for something. For example, while in a car or waiting for an appointment.</li>
<li>I use my MacBook Air when I have to actively take notes (I type faster than writing) while reading a technical book.</li>
<li>I occasionally read on my iPad if the book is filled with immersive graphics.</li>
<li>I listen to audiobooks when I am doing tasks that don&rsquo;t require me to think a lot. Examples are: running &amp; cycling, chores, walking in commutes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-i-know-what-to-read">How I know what to read:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a person I know recommends a non-fiction book to me, I&rsquo;ll buy it straight to Kindle. It takes a certain effort to finish a non-fiction book, and one way or the other, it affects that person, hence she/he would like to recommend it.</li>
<li>I used to base it from &ldquo;a list&rdquo; or &ldquo;best sellers&rdquo; or the really popular ones. I think that&rsquo;s fine, especially when you&rsquo;re just starting out the habit. These days, I&rsquo;m more intentional about what books to read depending on what Stoicism, so I already have a specific set of expectations on what to get in reading a book - rather than the &ldquo;surprise me&rdquo; or &ldquo;feel high&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There are books that are &ldquo;light-reading&rdquo;, most of the words are not technical and you can read it even if your toddler is jumping around the bed. I just simply read them for the sake of reading it. I enjoy some trash novels from time to time. üôÇ</li>
<li>I also use the 10% principle. If you&rsquo;re at the 10% mark and really struggling, try skipping a chapter or revisit the table of contents. If it&rsquo;s really such a job for you to read it, abandon it. Revisit it later if it becomes relevant to you at that specific point in time.</li>
<li>There are times I actually Google or watch a video on YouTube about the book or the author before reading. This just paints a better picture of the author, her/his thoughts, and intentions. Also, the easiest way to detect b***t.</li>
<li>Lately, I&rsquo;m now avoiding the &ldquo;glorified blog posts&rdquo; books. You know, there&rsquo;s a blog about it. Then the author just double-downed on that topic, find repetitive examples, put more narratives into it, but the value and quality density is just the same as that blog post.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot more reasons on why read books. I&rsquo;m just adding a bit to that force by this post. There are many researches that support it, there are a lot of &ldquo;successful people&rdquo; who recommend reading, you know you should do it. Do it &ldquo;just because.&rdquo; If you struggle, let me know. Maybe I can help.</p>
<h2 id="so-in-conclusion">So in conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Get out from the inner conflict of reading a book. Whatever past bias that you have, fight it and get rid of it.</li>
<li>Read books you enjoy or you know that can affect you. Don&rsquo;t think of it like the way it is in schools. A teacher won&rsquo;t give you a failed mark if you don&rsquo;t finish it.</li>
<li>It takes time to find the right book reading method that suites you. Also, maybe it keeps changing. What&rsquo;s important is you keep trying.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the books that you would like to recommend? Let me know.</p>
