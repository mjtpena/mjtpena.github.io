<ul>
<li>Andriel is now back on track in terms of his engagement and focus when doing therapies.</li>
<li>Andriel is almost accurate with his &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nah&rdquo; where they are more in context and appropriate.</li>
<li>Beth and the family have worked on turn taking and it&rsquo;s showing progress as Andriel learns to wait.</li>
<li>Andriel can now recite most letters of the alphabet with the most difficulty on &ldquo;S&rdquo; sounds.</li>

<li>Andriel continues to immitate the last syllable of someone&rsquo;s words.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pre-schools">Pre-schools</h2>
<h3 id="-sdn-beranga-autism-specific">🌈 SDN Beranga (Autism Specific)</h3>
<p>We had our planning session with the key educator, and we&rsquo;ve established these goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus Time</strong>. Andriel tends to get distracted most of the time, and having to sit in a chair for extended hour is a challenge. We want to improve it.</li>
<li><strong>Expressive Skills</strong>. We want to empower Andriel to let him express what he needs and wants by giving him opportunities to speak or request appropriately.</li>
<li><strong>School readiness</strong>. This topic is broad, but having an understanding of &ldquo;where things should be&rdquo; is the primary focus.</li>
<li>General safety such as following <strong>stop instructions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>SDN continues to observe Andriel and finds the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participates in food play activities</li>
<li>Actively using toilets</li>
<li>Participates in puzzle activities</li>
<li>Andriel tends to climb and jump on high grounds.</li>

<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410213144.png" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="-primary-schools">🪜 Primary Schools</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time lately in applying to different schools around Austral (South-West) area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our preferred school for Andriel is <strong>Aspect Macarthur</strong>.
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve submitted most documents and just waiting for: Cognitive report (Ben) and Up to date diagnosis (Geoffrey)</li>
<li>We are waiting for Andriel&rsquo;s next Paediatrician (Geoffrey) appointment this May to have an up to date diagnosis for Andriel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Catholic Schools</strong>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve applied to various catholic schools around the area.</li>
<li>Some schools doesn&rsquo;t have support for special / support classes.</li>
<li>Some are in the process and just waiting for their Diverse Learning coordinator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Austral Public School</strong>.
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve submitted all documents and enrollment forms.</li>
<li>Robyn from Department of Education have also submitted her reports.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re just waiting for next steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="home-and-family-activities">🏡Home and Family Activities</h1>
<h2 id="home-updates">Home Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>House</strong>. The last rental place in Ingleburn had a lot of water trouble and we have moved to a new rental place in Leumeah, NSW (Campbeltown). We&rsquo;ve secured a lot in Austral, NSW. We&rsquo;re in the process of finalising our house plans and ETA of completion is around January 2023. If all goes well, Andriel will start his Primary school in Austral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Toileting</strong>. Andriel doesn&rsquo;t use nappies anymore on day times. He tends to go for a &ldquo;Wee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poo&rdquo; when prompted to go to the toilet. Sometimes he shows gestures of discomfort, and we proceed to go to the toilet. We will keep doing this for the next few weeks, then we&rsquo;ll also try to remove nappies at night time as we need more observation for this. In the near future, we want him to be more expressive and inform us when he needs to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dentists</strong>. The family had a general check-up of our teeth since Covid. The good thing is that Andriel didn&rsquo;t throw a tantrum throughout the session: when the dentist said &ldquo;AHHH&rdquo;, he would open his mouth. Unfortunately, Andriel have a lot of broken teeth that needs fixing as it&rsquo;s too early for him to lose a lot of teeth. He was referred to a specialist and we found out that he needs a dental surgery (with sedation) to fix those teeth. It&rsquo;s currently scheduled on May 19th.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410140406.png" alt="img"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home Therapies</strong>. We continue his &ldquo;training&rdquo; and development at home. The parents make sure that he gets at least 30 minutes 1-on-1 everyday to work on his goals. We are focusing on expressive skills, turn takings and pen activities. We also noticed that on his limited screen times, he tends to interact (mimicing words) with the songs that he listens lately.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410140911.png" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="-photos-and-activities">📸 Photos and Activities</h2>
<p>The past few weeks are mostly raining but on the days that are sunny, we tend to have fun outdoors. On these days, we also make sure to give Andriel the opportunity to express himself from asking him to &ldquo;where is the dog?&rdquo;, &ldquo;are you hungry?&rdquo;, &ldquo;toilet?&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410141101.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410141047.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410220653.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Andriel was able to observe people screaming from the ride, and shows a form of &ldquo;mimicking&rdquo; and felt the excitement of other people.</p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410220934.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>On some days when it&rsquo;s a rainy weekend, we find places where Andriel can still have fun indoors. His favourite is <strong>Flip Out</strong>. Andriel was jumping, running, and climbing for almost 2 hours straight! He&rsquo;s so happy seeing a lot of people around him jumping.</p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410140235.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410140312.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>We expose him to movie theatres to practice being in a community; and Andriel have shown focus on movies that is appealing to him like Sonic the Hedgehog. He was able to sit down for the duration of the movie and didn&rsquo;t cause a lot of noise. The other movie on the other hand (Fantastic Beast) is a different story.</p>

<h1 id="-whats-coming-and-notes-from-parents">⏭️ What&rsquo;s coming and Notes from Parents?</h1>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a boy! Andriel will become a big brother soon. He tends to rub and kiss mum&rsquo;s belly these days.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2022/04/20220410220518.png" alt="img"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are currently limiting Andriel&rsquo;s sugar intake, and people might see some changes in his mood.</p>
</li>
