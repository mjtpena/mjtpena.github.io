<strong>My Battle Station @ 2021</strong></p>
<p>In a parallel world, I&rsquo;ll be just using 1 device and 1 Operating system for all the things. However, given the nature of my work with mobile, web, blockchain, machine learning, and cloud development, I need to have multiple devices to cater things.</p>
<p>I tried doing &ldquo;Shared mouse and keyboard&rdquo; in the past such as Synergy, but I decided to use a KVM switch instead. The main reason for this is context switching, so that I don&rsquo;t get distracted and I have a &ldquo;physical switch&rdquo; to tell myself &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to do&hellip;&rdquo; I also intentionally placed the KVM switch near my foot, so I have to force myself to dock to press that button.</p>
<p>This blog post is about how I use MacOS and Windows to various workflow that I do as a business owner and software engineer.</p>
<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>
<ul>
<li>Desktop (i9, 128GB RAM, RTX 3080 ti, 2TB SSD) that runs Windows 10</li>
<li>Macbook Pro 16‚Ä≥ (i9, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) for main use</li>
<li>M1 Macbook Air for portable use</li>
<li>KVM Switch: Display and Accessories</li>
<li>3 Monitors with different lengths with VESA support
<ul>
<li>2 of which are attached to KVM Switch, and the other one I have to unplug/plug to Windows Desktop/Mac</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Logitech MX Master 3 plugged to KVM switch</li>
<li>Logitech Steelseeries mechanical keyboard plugged to KVM switch.</li>
<li>Blue Yeti Snowball microphone attached to KVM switch</li>
<li>Bose QC35 for headset paired to both MacOS and Windows Desktop</li>
<li>1080p Logitech web cam attached to Windows Desktop only</li>
<li>Generic sound bar speaker attached to Windows Desktop only</li>
<li>Generic lighting equipment</li>
<li>Dongles (USB-C to HDMI/USB-A) mainly for Mac</li>
<li>Mobile Phones (iPhones and Android phones) for testing purposes</li>
<li>A pen and a hard bound notebook if I need to draw something</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="windows-workflow">Windows workflow</h1>
<h2 id="general-business-and-office">General Business and Office</h2>
<p>When writing proposals and other business related documents, I still prefer to use Microsoft Word for Windows as it is complete with all the features that I need.</p>
<p>Excel for Windows in my experience has been more stable than the MacOS equivalent. Running complex formula and loading a lot of data, is a much smoother experience for me. I don&rsquo;t even bother with non-Excel app at all.</p>
<p>Although I can open all websites to any device with a browser (and sync bookmarks), I prefer to use this machine for all business related sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banking websites</li>
<li>Accounting websites (Quickbooks/Xero)</li>
<li>Document signing and business registrations</li>
<li>Outsourcing (Fiverr, Upwork, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="primary-presenter">Primary Presenter</h2>
<p>NVIDIA Broadcast is a game changer for me. I live in a place where constant noise is passing by, so Broadcast&rsquo;s capability to do noise cancellation (for free) is really good.</p>
<p>Powerpoint for Windows has been my default tool of choice for slides, as it is complete with all the features that I need. The MacOS equivalent, Keynote, and Google Slides lack some of the advanced features that I need.</p>
<p>All my collaboration and messaging apps also lives in Windows (with backup on MacOS):</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Teams</li>
<li>Zoom</li>
<li>Cisco WebEx</li>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>Discord</li>
<li>Facebook Messenger (App)</li>
<li>Signal &amp; WhatsApp</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-research">General Research</h2>
<p>Although I obviously have browsers across all devices, I use the Windows machine as my <code>go to</code> research device. This means I use this for <code>googling</code> things and scroll to various materials such as books, articles, research papers.</p>
<p>I use [[RoamResearch]] as my single dump of all my notes and general writing. It&rsquo;s my &ldquo;second brain.&rdquo; This is <code>my choice of tool</code> that works across all platforms. I make sure all notes are dumped here.</p>
<p>I also use Instapaper to convert web links that I want to read later on.</p>
<h2 id="net-and-windows-desktop-development">.NET and Windows Desktop Development</h2>
<p>The full Visual Studio (2019) for Windows is very helpful when working on big .NET projects. It comes with a lot of GUI tools that I am already familiar since the beginning of my .NET journey in 2009.</p>
<p>I also have a project right now that deals with Win32 and a lot of native Windows modules such as NativeWifi and Active Directory. This is a hard dependency of using a Windows machine for this specific projects.</p>
<p>A couple of years back when I was playing out Hololens, Mixed Reality, and Unity; I was only able to do it in Windows.</p>
<h2 id="azure-development-and-infrastructure">Azure Development and Infrastructure</h2>
<p>I installed Azure CLI on Windows mainly because of Powershell. I have a lot of ARM templates and automation scripts that are in Powershell and it&rsquo;s just a good context to mix this with Azure CLI on Windows.</p>
<p>It also happened to be that a lot of my Azure related projects are within the Microsoft ecosystem: SQL Server (SSMS), ASP.NET, and Windows IoT - again something I prefer to do in the Windows ecosystem because of familiarity.</p>
<h2 id="blockchain-development">Blockchain Development</h2>
<p>I use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for these purposes. I install all the dependencies around it. The commons are: NodeJS (NVM), Go, Rust, Python, and a bunch of CLI tools.</p>
<p>I use Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE in writing smart contracts. The fun part of using VSCode is that, I can always target WSL2 for debugging and deploying purposes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very new to Go and Rust as a trendy programming languages. Learning them through WSL2 is a very cool sandboxed environment for me to play around.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-development">Machine Learning Development</h2>
<p>I worked on a ML.NET project, and using a Windows machine works perfectly. Although it&rsquo;s not really dependent on the OS, I just really find the fun of working with .NET on Windows in general - again familiarity.</p>
<p>I used to bother installing Anaconda, Keras, TensorFlow, and all other Python dependencies on Windows (and tried on WSL), but I didn&rsquo;t find the experience pleasant. These days, I just use a managed server / cluster on cloud ie Jupyter kernel, Databricks, Azure ML, and Azure Synapse.</p>
<h1 id="macos-workflow">MacOS workflow</h1>
<h2 id="mobile-development">Mobile Development</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re developing an iPhone app, it&rsquo;s always a need to have a MacOS machine. Specially when you&rsquo;re dealing with application signing, bundling, certificates - they all live in the close walled gardens of Apple.</p>
<p>Although I can use Windows for Android development, I just prefer to use a Mac so that I have a single device to work on &ldquo;just mobile&rdquo;. This goes with the rest of the Android suite: ADB, JDKs, SDKs, Gradle, Scala, Groovy, and Maven.</p>
<p>I also work on Cross-Platform technologies like Xamarin, React Native, Flutter, Swift UI, and based from experience, it&rsquo;s a much smoother experience to have this workflow on a MacOS. Otherwise, you will be working on Android only, then think about iOS as an after thought.</p>
<h2 id="macos-desktop-development">MacOS Desktop Development</h2>
<p>I am also working on a MacOS Desktop project, and with no surprise you will be needing a Mac hardware for this.</p>
<p>On a separate note, I don&rsquo;t find AppleScript as a fun experience. But Swift is a really good programming language to work on. :)</p>
<h2 id="web-front-end-javascripttypescript-development">Web Front-end (JavaScript/TypeScript) Development</h2>
<p>These days I usually work on a React frontend. I did touch on some Angular and Vue, but my involvement is very minimal. It&rsquo;s all the familiar toolset of NodeJS, TypeScript, and npm tools and packages.</p>
<p>I prefer to work on MacOS for Web Front-end development because of Safari! Although the whole world is really about Chrome, most web projects require for it to work on Safari.</p>
<p>Also given that when I work on React Native, I do it on a Mac. The context switching of sharing those React components across mobile and web, it&rsquo;s just easier to test on a single machine.</p>
<h2 id="java-everywhere">Java everywhere</h2>
<p>Java is a programming language and platform that I didn&rsquo;t particularly prefer, but an inevitable thing that you see time and time again in your career. Given that my Android development workflow is in MacOS, all things Java related, I just do them on MacOS too.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I prefer to use Windows for the &ldquo;Office work&rdquo;, .NET &amp; Azure Development, and my primary presenting device. WSL also brings a lot of flexibility to have Linux without the need of VMs or Dual Boot.</p>
<p>I prefer to use MacOS for all things mobile and web front-end. Although a lot of these workflows can be done on Windows, the energy of iOS/MacOS/Swift just drags me back to sticking with MacOS.</p>
<p>In an alternative universe, if XCode Tools and general iOS development becomes available as a Docker Container or WSM (Windows Subsystem for MacOS), then Windows will be my one and only device.</p>
