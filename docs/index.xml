      <description>Losing weight is actually very simple. You’ll literally just have to eat less. It’s that simple. Then, of course, losing weight does not really equate to being healthy.</description>

      <description>So you keep hearing or reading about &amp;ldquo;tokens&amp;rdquo;, these &amp;ldquo;cryptos&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;blockchain bitcoins&amp;rdquo;, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite some time now that it has involved me with blockchains and cryptos that over and over, I have to explain to people (often new clients) on what are these tokens.</description>

      <description>There are some legitimate excuse in my opinion to burn the midnight oil - aka work late at night. I do this so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to work over the weekends, and I can spend a lot of quality time with my family.</description>

      <description>Practice makes perfect. Maybe not &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; for everyone, but close to the objective or your goal. It takes a lot of repetition to truly master a craft or a profession, you need to spend a lot of those hours in order to learn what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>Motivation is something that everyone needs in order to thrive in their day. Having motivation is like taking a bath: not because you had it yesterday, you&amp;rsquo;ll be okay for today and tomorrow.</description>

      <description>A productive day at work means I get to finish tasks that I committed on time. This rarely happens because either the estimates are wrong, or there are just so many things that happens unexpectedly.</description>

      <description>Learn to shut up. It&amp;rsquo;s easier said than done. Especially if you grew up to speak what&amp;rsquo;s on your mind. However, we weren&amp;rsquo;t taught how to listen - like properly listen to a person, surrounding, a video, and even thoughts.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that there is such thing as a &amp;ldquo;deadline&amp;rdquo; or end of life for a project. You just define what you want to build given the time, resources, and talent that is available for you.</description>
