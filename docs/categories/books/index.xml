      <description>Before 2018, I was never a book reader. Reading a book seems like a chore to me. I can barely finish a chapter. I always had that internal conflict (possibly based from childhood experience) that only &amp;ldquo;the smart people&amp;rdquo; can read books. Another factor is, I&amp;rsquo;ve always associated books to &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;academia&amp;rdquo; that felt like an enclosed culture that didn&amp;rsquo;t really synced in to me. Also, I&amp;rsquo;d rather watch a film or TV series than read a 300 to 500 pager book - because of cinematics.</description>
