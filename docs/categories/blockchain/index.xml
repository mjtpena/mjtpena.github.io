      <description>So you keep hearing or reading about &amp;ldquo;tokens&amp;rdquo;, these &amp;ldquo;cryptos&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;blockchain bitcoins&amp;rdquo;, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite some time now that it has involved me with blockchains and cryptos that over and over, I have to explain to people (often new clients) on what are these tokens. Even until now, at almost late 2021, I still get asked about these: Is it Bitcoin? Is it Ethereum? Is it Coin X, Coin Y?</description>

      <description>Introduction Blockchain is not dead. Actually, quite the contrary is happening in the past year. There are more and more interest and it&amp;rsquo;s gaining a lot more traction than before. A big portion of this growth is due to &amp;ldquo;DeFi&amp;rdquo; AKA Decentralised Finance applications. From the hyped cryptocurrencies, we are now seeing the new next wave of this transformation as we see more financial products being developed: lending, exchanges, yield farming, and pools just to name a few.</description>
