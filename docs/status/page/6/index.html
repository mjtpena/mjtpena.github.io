        <p>Plants, plants, plants - and more plants. My wife is really into plants and I support her on to that one. We probably have a hundred plants right now at home, and that&rsquo;s alright. I let her have that hobby and ownership of these cute little (and not so little) objects in our house. There will never be enough plants in our lives. They actually give good aesthetics to our place and makes it more breathable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things that I&rsquo;ve just developed an appreciation of but not really willing to commit on working / maintaining it. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m already busy or have a hundred things I&rsquo;d rather do, but it&rsquo;s just something that I didn&rsquo;t really like doing. The process is very important in order to have meaningful outcome, and I don&rsquo;t like the process of cultivating plants. I&rsquo;m a supportive husband in a way that I don&rsquo;t mind having &ldquo;a lot of it&rdquo; and willing to drive her distances just to have the right ones.</p>

        <p>I like planning for the week ahead. It&rsquo;s something I realised that is so effective in my line of work. If I don&rsquo;t plan my schedule well, I will just be reactive of things and won&rsquo;t have any focus. This usually leads to not being productive and a lot of demotivation. Although in the ideal world, things won&rsquo;t go wrong and your schedule will just work - obviously that&rsquo;s not the reality. It&rsquo;s probably a balance of trying to achieve at least 80% of what you planned and sacrificing 20% that are not really that much of a priority to you. I spend an hour or two of my weekend just to reflect on the past week, and plan for the week ahead.</p>
<p>On a high level, I like having 1 to 3 key deliverables for a day and will only work on that one, the rest are just &ldquo;burners&rdquo; or extras. Ideally in a day, the things that I really like doing, I should have finished them in the morning so that the rest of the afternoon and night are spent on things that are more geared towards your interests such as family time, hobbies, and other not so heavy mental work.</p>

        <p>Breakfast as they say is the most important meal of the day. I&rsquo;m not really sure if that applies to me. I tend not to eat on breakfasts or just eat something small portioned instead. I tend to be more productive if I don&rsquo;t feel bloated or dizzy after a very heavy meal. The problem that I have is that I have the impulse to overeat or stress eat, which is something I have to work on separately. This is the reason why I want to start with not eating so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now going back to the routine of just eating one meal a day, and the rest are just fluids or liquids. I just drink a cup of coffee or a shake. I need to lose weight not just because of general aesthetics purposes, but as a long-lived lifestyle. I of all people inherited all the bad genes from my mom and dad in terms of health diseases. I want to live long enough that it&rsquo;s a balance of I&rsquo;ve eaten things that I want but on moderation, and the rest are spent on good experiences.</p>

        <p>I like waking up early in the morning when everything is still quiet and calm. The sunrise gives me a feeling of warmth that radiates energy for the day ahead. This is a ceremony that it&rsquo;s really a new day ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now re-developing a habit of waking up early again (sometime between 5:00 to 7:00 AM). Whenever I set myself for a successful morning, I know that I&rsquo;ll stick to the routine all throughout the day. It&rsquo;s about consistency and making things &ldquo;easy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If executed well, it&rsquo;s also the best time to learn something new or do challenging &ldquo;deep work tasks&rdquo;. The reason why I want to work on this routine again, is because comes 9:00 AM onwards, it&rsquo;s pure chaos of calls and unexpected things again (a separate mental model to apply). I want to make sure that I own the day ahead and be in control!</p>

        <p>You don‚Äôt wake up thinking ‚ÄúWhat should I do today?‚Äù For sure, you know what you want to do, you know what you ‚Äúneed‚Äù to do. You know what will give you that 1% progress in your career goals, habits, and spiritual wellbeing.</p>
<p>You should instead wake up saying ‚ÄúI will do this.‚Äù I want to do this ‚Äúbecause.‚Äù When you convince yourself that you will commit to the action, it propels to getting things done. When things get done, that‚Äôs when you see progress. And continuous progress will lead to eventual ‚Äúsuccess.‚Äù</p>
<p>And then you call it a day, you then sleep. Tomorrow, you do the same thing. Maybe you‚Äôll be working on a different goal that time, maybe it‚Äôs the same boring task; whatever it is, you know you‚Äôre doing it towards success.</p>

        <p>Reading is the most immersive and informative way of understanding a topic or subject. Although this takes a lot of time and effort, especially when you‚Äôre just beginning with your journey as a reader, it will be a fun and fulfilling activity to take daily. There is so much you can learn everyday just by reading. It will help you a lot in your career if you learn ‚Äúhow to learn‚Äù; and reading effectively is one principle that you have to understand and practice too.</p>
<p>The problems that most people had is that they wanted ‚Äúto read a book‚Äù and not ‚Äúbecome a reader‚Äù and there is a big difference. Reading should be a lifestyle of choice, rather than a medium to consume just a specific topic. It‚Äôs unfortunate that less and fewer people are inclined in to reading, because of the abundance of short-lived social media contents. It takes a lot of time for an author to publish a book, with very little monetary return on their end. So consuming that content that took them months or even years of hard work is such an excellent investment on its own.</p>

        <p>12 hours of sleep. Wow, it‚Äôs been a while since I had that. I can‚Äôt really remember when was the last time that happened. It felt so good to be that energized and ready to become productive after a long, painful night of flu. I was alone in a comfortable bed mattress, it‚Äôs so quiet, and the weather &amp; temperature was just right. It‚Äôs seldom that this happens. No phone calls, no disturbances, no notifications, no nothing. That is indeed what makes me rich. I guess sleep is now the good measurement of how wealthy you really are.</p>
<p>The feeling was way better than having to watch late night movies or binge watching/playing something. Sleep is one of the best reward in this world. A good quality sleep lets you feel better all throughout. I should probably take more long hour of sleep once in a while.</p>
