        <p>Cleaning as a concept is very foreign to me until I became fully independent in life. I didn‚Äôt really understand back then the reason I should clean anything. The problem was, someone else has always been doing it for me. I don‚Äôt see the value of doing it, or I have some pride about someone else should do it. A chore is something that is coined as ‚Äúfree work‚Äù hence, I don‚Äôt get incentivised in doing it. To be honest, I think I was spoiled. I should have known better back then.</p>
<p>However, these past few years, I actually developed some habits of cleaning here and there. As I spend most of my time in a day in front of devices, cleaning is actually a form of healthy distraction on my end. I enjoy washing dishes these days, because I get to relax my mind and feel the plates more thoroughly. I enjoy doing vacuum cleaning, as it‚Äôs just soothing to see dirt get sucked in. I enjoy getting things in order now, and seeing more tangible progress directly from my actions. It‚Äôs like seeing outcomes instantly, just like how you get gratifications from scrolling your news feed. These days, I would consider cleaning as a break or, to a point, meditating as an experience.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt really consider myself as a hardcore gamer. At least right now. I‚Äôve always been a casual gamer, where I enjoyed it the most when I‚Äôm playing with friends or trying to immerse with the story. Gone are the days where I have spent countless hours of my life just trying to ‚Äúlevel-up‚Äù on a game and increase a virtual attribute of my character. There‚Äôs just so much else to work on instead. I‚Äôm lucky that from time to time, such as one long breaks in December, I get to play those casual games. I usually finish 2 to 3 adventure games during those times. Those are the times when I really break my body clock. It feels well deserved and fulfilling.</p>
<p>I enjoy a different lifestyle right now with business, technology, and family as more of the drivers of my endorphins or ‚Äúhigh.‚Äù It‚Äôs really fascinating to immerse in code and business problem to tackle on than games / puzzles right now. I play a lot with my kid and I really enjoy them. But the ‚Äúplay‚Äù and the ‚Äútoys‚Äù aspect of it are a just medium for me to connect with him or teach him skills.</p>
<p>Maybe when I retire or grow old, I spend a lot of time gaming again. But for now, it‚Äôs just a holiday leisure.</p>

        <p>There is no going back to normal. It took me a while to get it, but that is the sad and harsh truth. Our lives have changed in the past two years, that I can‚Äôt actually imagine how ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will actually look like. I know it‚Äôs depressing. Even for a very optimistic like me, I am still getting the toll of the lockdowns, the COVID-19 news. It‚Äôs a lot of emotions to take in once you get succumb to social media and the news, it‚Äôs like the world is just ending. I‚Äôm just living in the bubble of my house, my remote work, and digital footprint (social media and television).</p>
<p>We need to move forward from this. I know it‚Äôs a tough situation to crack. I don‚Äôt have the right background in terms of health, economy, or politics to figure out how we can really solve these. One thing I‚Äôm just sure of is we have to work together for this to happen. Whether it‚Äôs about following safety protocols, getting vaccinated, and just respecting others. We will have a better world after we overcome this. I miss a lot of the tech conferences, the meet-ups, the out of country trips, and meeting different type of people. I need to keep dreaming that better days will come, because if people don‚Äôt then we‚Äôve already lost.</p>

        <p>Collaborating using share screen is fun. I think this is the modern way of doing pair-programming. This is a very efficient method for both people to learn, share ideas, and collaborate. I recently have done it, and I would guarantee that we‚Äôve done more work together than doing things separately. It‚Äôs very important, especially if you‚Äôre at the early phase of the project, to foster collaboration. The underlying foundations of the work that you‚Äôre doing are very critical in the beginning.</p>
<p>Given the chance, I would always want to do this with people so that I can scale myself when getting involved with a lot of different things. This will allow me to be invisible in the future and the project and program would still go on. This approach would also allow me to improve on my technical skills while having someone who will be my accountability partner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not something that people still adapt today for a lot of reasons. There are insecurities in terms of personalities and fear of mistakes. I think of your career, overcome those insecurities in life. Pair programming is fun. We don‚Äôt know everything, no one does. It‚Äôs important to share goals and objectives and create value together! Also, it‚Äôs fun as this cultivates friendship too!</p>

        <p>The human mind and body are funny and amazing at the same time. We do a lot of things that make little sense on a high level or just by looking at it literally. One example I keep thinking about is the concept of ‚Äúresting‚Äù such as taking sleeps, naps, or doing recreational activities. We‚Äôre unique as species because we have our own concept of ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù and rationale to answer ‚Äúwhy you want to do it‚Äù. This goes to my question of why do I like to do other ‚Äústressful‚Äù activities such as running, or doing side projects, or doing long drives to have a break from my ‚Äúmain gig‚Äù.</p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs very important to understand who you are and what motivates you because this will help you understand your limits and potentials. Once you know more about yourself, then you would have a reason ‚Äúwhy you are doing it‚Äù. For me, I really like doing things that are related to technology, hence instead of pouring all 120 hours of my life per week on my main work, I make sure I evenly distribute my attention and energy for my family, work, side projects, hobbies, and relaxation. This works for me. Maybe it won‚Äôt work for you, but our bodies and minds are so amazing!</p>

        <p>Hybrid cloud is the trend right now I see in a lot of companies and enterprises. The term hybrid has grown too in the last couple of years. It just showed connectivity between an on-premises data center to public clouds like AWS and Azure. This time, hybrid now also means multi-cloud strategy and edge computing. It‚Äôs about borderless connectivity across different topologies or deployment models happening around.</p>
<p>Edge computing is an interest to me, because there are a lot of operations that would make sense in an isolated environment. Video analytics and computer vision are some of the prime examples of using edge technologies. Companies shouldn‚Äôt send all the streaming data to the public in order to extract analytics from it. We want a faster but cost efficient model in performing these complex operations. It‚Äôs not ideal to set up a whole data center in an isolated area.</p>
<p>There are so many exciting improvements happening in both Hybrid Cloud, IoT, and AI. These are the ones that are slowly changing the way we approach computing and businesses. We are really embracing a more decentralized infrastructure, one way or the other, for all your ‚Äúcompute‚Äù requirements. I want to see more and more use cases of IoT and AI on edge in the future.</p>

        <p>All things that need to be built have some sort of ‚Äúmaster plan.‚Äù When you‚Äôre building a house or a building, you have a reference point of what it would look like in a design document. It‚Äôs good to have this, because the effort and cost of constructing projects would be costly. It‚Äôs good to have a plan early on.</p>
<p>Now that I‚Äôm reflecting about it in the Software and IT industry, we don‚Äôt use that much ‚ÄúMaster Document‚Äù anymore, since projects and products constantly develop. Unlike houses, it‚Äôs very unlikely that the house will change within a few months‚Äô time. In Software, you do increments, patches, and enhancements from time to time.</p>
<p>In the future, I think we might still have a concept of ‚Äúmaster plan‚Äù or at least a version 1 of a design. As the product or object strengthens, so is the design document. It should be constantly improved. For minor projects, you don‚Äôt have to have a very elaborate design, but having a design is better than not having one at all!</p>
