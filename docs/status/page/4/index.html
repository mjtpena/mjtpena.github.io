        <p>Money is just an instrument. It&rsquo;s a means to get or achieve something. It&rsquo;s not the reason to live nor should be the cause of break-ups and damaging relationships. We all need money in order to at least get the minimum requirements to live: shelter, food, health, and safety. Anything beyond that is on the &ldquo;wants&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s subjective person to person.</p>
<p>I am at peace of the money that I have and the money that I will own in the future. I am on track to be wealthy by having the right disciplines, principles, and investments in place. I don&rsquo;t want to live by the day just to earn more money, I want to have enough money so that I don&rsquo;t have to work on other things that I don&rsquo;t particularly like.</p>
<p>I want to be in control of my time, which is the most valuable resource. Money is just a means to save time and effort on things that doesn&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>

        <p>There is so much happening in the NFT space right now, it&rsquo;s so interesting, fascinating, and intimidating at the same time. While most of my circles are still stuck in to the enterprise applications and the more traditional web &amp; mobile applications, a select people are changing the world by storm. There is a little fear of missing out on my end, but for me that&rsquo;s really adding some spice to this universe. It&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>At this point, I have at least 3 involvements in this game. Instead of just watching or investing on the side, I am building things that might turn to actual products and profit. I am happy to really pour in my time to this. I can&rsquo;t get distracted right now with other naysayers and things. I think it&rsquo;s time to really focus up my game on this. Less time on social media as a consumer, but more time as a producer and builder.</p>

        <p>Newsletters are fun. It&rsquo;s a way to consume information that are specific for an audience. I actually subscribe to a bunch of them. It&rsquo;s my way of getting updated on a topic that interests me, but at the same time, still curated and fact-checked by someone smarter than me in that field.</p>
<p>In the increasingly connected world of social media, we tend to find content that are more fitted to our needs and interests. There is just so much information happening around, and we just don&rsquo;t have enough time and effort to consume all of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started a newsletter for my son, in order to inform different member of the groups about his updates and what&rsquo;s happening around him. I found it intuitive and interesting enough that made me do it more than just for the numbers. What I&rsquo;ve learned is that content is king, the medium or platform is just secondary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have much interest in creating my own newsletter yet, as I am still finding my niche in this game. I am considering to really go back to the world of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, as this topic keeps pulling me back and back again.</p>

        <p>Meetings are one of the killers of productivity. Specially if you have other functions or roles beside attending and organizing meetings. For example, if you&rsquo;re also a developer or a knowledge person who needs enough focus to get on with a productive and meaningful outcome.</p>
<p>Some meetings are really ideal when there are so many unknowns and we want to collaborate and just get on with it, instead of bouncing on/off with emails and chat. However, in my opinion, it would only make sense if all or most of the attendees are participating. I don&rsquo;t get the reason of participating in events if I won&rsquo;t even be talking or what others are talking about doesn&rsquo;t relate to me.</p>
<p>I am becoming more notorious in missing meetings and all the FYI town halls and events. However, I am also noticing that I&rsquo;m getting more productive output done, as I don&rsquo;t get too much distracted with things. I do attend meetings if something is burning, or we&rsquo;re planning something meaningful and there will be clear actions for everyone right after the event.</p>

        <p>Trolls are people on the internet who have the intention of getting in to your nerves by distracting you with bashful or hurtful comments. They are masked with a fake account and doesn&rsquo;t really show who they are and how they are related to you. Some of them are just completely random, some of them are targeted from your peers and network.</p>
<p>The moment you entertain them, then they become successful on what they intended to do. So the best course of action is to just ignore them. I haven&rsquo;t experienced that much trolling in my life, as I am not really in the mood for a fight and would be better of spending that time to something else. I don&rsquo;t tolerate them. I don&rsquo;t even think about them late at night.</p>
<p>For as long as you and your family is safe, then you don&rsquo;t really have to worry about it that much. Some people are just bored and miserable in their lives, and got nothing better to do. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a question of who really suffers and how. For as long as you don&rsquo;t get affected mentally and you still get ahead of your day, then all should be fine. You only have limited amount of time and energy in this world, so better spend them somewhere that makes more impact and sense - things that you really care about.</p>

        <p>The best advice you can give to someone (or even yourself) is &ldquo;to become a serial achiever.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;to be rich&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be successful&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be the best X professional&rdquo;. Most of these are too vague, too shallow, too specific, and most of the time not relatable and practical for the rest of 99% population. Also, continuity is important as this brings you on to &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next&rdquo; after reaching a specific outcome.</p>
<p>Serial achievers are great into many things. Maybe you want to become a successful entrepreneur AND a passionate gamer while being a great husband. Be an author &amp; public speaker while being a supportive parent to your son. Maybe what you want is to become an expert in a specific field/technology and a tri-athlete, while maintaining a successful portfolio of investments. Maybe an accountant who have a successful YouTube channel. A global executive of a multi-national company and an active member of a spiritual community while being a good friend.</p>
<p>Whatever ANDs you choose, something has to give - and that&rsquo;s fine. You can also keep changing priorities as you reach certain milestones. Note that you can&rsquo;t have it all, but you can definitely do a lot. And that lot, is enough to live a happy and purposeful life.</p>

        <p>I never really understood why I wanted a vertically mounted monitor. I mean, it&rsquo;s cool and &ldquo;different&rdquo; but I still haven&rsquo;t seen the real use case of it. I think the whole idea is for it to be just open on the side and it&rsquo;s not really the primary focus for you to work on.</p>
<p>Based from my observation in the last couple of months, I find that all I need is 1 really good monitor, then everything else are extras. Whether the secondary is horizontal or vertical, it needs to be positioned as secondary.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ll be doing is exploring this to monitor graphs such as stocks, cloud resources, and my always open notes. It&rsquo;s probably a good place to put on timers, music players like Spotify.</p>
