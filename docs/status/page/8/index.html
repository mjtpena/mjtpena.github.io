        <p>I would say that one of the best things that change in my character is how I can remain calm despite of stress and general disappointments in life. I realized it is so tiring to be angry with something if you know that it‚Äôs not really a battle worth fighting. I realized that you only have limited time in this world, and I don‚Äôt want to be live and be remembered as someone who is angry all the time.</p>
<p>On a day-to-day basis, I experience a lot of problems at work, my relationship, and general happenings as part of the pandemic. I want to stay calm when I can. When times get tough and rage is feeling up my nerves, I go to a safe place or channel (such as writing) to put on those negative emotions. I think, therefore, exercises and meditation would really help a lot with these kinds of things. I don‚Äôt want to be very rushed with decisions. Keep calm, think through it, then execute once you‚Äôre in a better thought process.</p>

        <p>I consider myself as a self-managed individual in terms of career and lifestyle. It occurred to me I don‚Äôt want anyone to manage ‚Äúme‚Äù personally in order to perform tasks and deliver results. This is not to be confused about having a project manager or coordinators I work with - most of them are outstanding. What I‚Äôm talking about are those who want to tell me how I should work or what I need to do. I have unlocked the side of my brain to think creatively and logically to align with business goals.</p>
<p>To an extent, I am also a project manager and coordinator. I give people technical directions about capabilities and what can be done. There are a lot of things to look at in terms of deliverables in a project, and communication is key. I would argue that I am an excellent communicator and I can deliver outstanding technical results too. What I lack right now are the sales chops to do the actual sales pitch and sell business commercials. That is something I am still learning and working on right now.</p>
<p>On an ideal day, I spend a portion of my morning and night time doing ‚Äúdeep technical work‚Äù like getting my hands dirty with coding and architecture diagrams. In the afternoon, I attend meetings and talk to people to collaborate; sometimes I also present. Then late afternoon to night time is family time. That is a good balance that works for me right now.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt really struggle to wake up early. Today I woke up at around 04:00 AM and it wasn‚Äôt a challenge at all. I am doing it because I find my writing and creative thinking to be early in the morning.</p>
<p>I am a mix of morning person and a night owl. I could spend the entire night being in the zone programming and solving problems, but I can also wake up early to begin my writing flow or do some ‚Äúdeep work.‚Äù However, if I need to finish something and I committed to doing it, then I‚Äôll do it regardless what time of the day it is.</p>
<p>I think what‚Äôs important is you actively explore and experiment what works best for you. Others would be equally productive by staying up late because of the calmness of the environment. It‚Äôs not about what time do you wake up. It‚Äôs about having a system that works for you.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve had a love and hate relationship with social media platforms in the past decade. Even until today, I haven‚Äôt really had a solid stance about these. I am aware of the dangers of these platforms when used excessively and inappropriately. I‚Äôve tried shutting down my social media accounts from time to time. I keep creating new ones too. Right now, my Instagram is deactivated. I probably spend around 4 to 5 hours a week on these platforms (better that before).</p>
<p>What changed this past year, though, is my aspiration to become a content producer instead. I want to keep a taking part in various activities and share my knowledge and various expertise. As much as possible, I don‚Äôt want to just be watching in the sidelines - I want to blend in. I want to keep on writing. I am now looking at creating various contents, such as participating in open source projects, creating YouTube videos, and so on.</p>
<p>I think what we need are more producers who have the skin in their game. We want people who will put on what they know and what they‚Äôre working on to make sure that you build authenticity and credibility. A lot of these so-called influencers are so overrated and don‚Äôt really bring a lot of value, at least not for me. What we need are more people who will bend the rules of the game. People who want to genuinely make a positive impact. I am part of that movement. Making the world a better place, one keystroke at a time.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve been contemplating for a while now if I want to pursue creating videos for [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]]. I have a lot of ideas on various topics, such as from creating video tutorials, to talk about life and my family. One thing that I want to cover in my personal career is the things that I‚Äôm working on in the AI, IoT and Edge space. I am thinking of doing some live streaming of learning from [[Microsoft Learn]] as well as from other source material such as [[Ethereum]].</p>
<p>My wife and I are also discussing creating a channel for my kid and his journey with [[Autism]]. There are also a lot of things to talk about, such as my move from Philippines to Australia. My career as a software engineer. The various topics of family and friendship. There is no scarcity of idea and content to build on. The biggest challenge is the time right now. I know that this will involve a lot of editing, marketing, and refinement to be successful in it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll have to sleep more in to it, but I think I would start something soon. Maybe let me do all of them on different channels? Me doing technology topics as a separate channel. Then a separate channel for our family and hobbies. Then another channel for my learning? We‚Äôll see.</p>

        <p>Writing every day is one of my goals for this year. I think I‚Äôm doing really well on that front. Obviously there are days I wasn‚Äôt able to write about because of various reasons such as being on a holiday or focusing on other activities, but the habit is there and well developed already. I keep a journal of what‚Äôs on my head and what I‚Äôm feeling, as this is the only way to make myself sane at this pandemic. The idea of suppressing all of those thoughts and questions in your head is just making me crazy.</p>
<p>Having to write every day also allows me to reflect on how the day has been. This is something that is important right now because, being in lockdown, you feel you‚Äôre just running a never-ending treadmill - like a rinse and repeat days. I would recommend writing to anyone as this allows you to create treasure in life that you can always travel back to. Feeling down today? Why not read something that you wrote when you were thrilled.</p>
<p>Write not for someone, obviously not for everyone, to be pleased. Write because it‚Äôs for you. Write because something is important to you. Write because you care deeply about the subject. Write ‚Äújust because.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Messaging is probably one of the most interesting topic in software for me. This is a state when a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù is being sent from an origin to a destination. Traditionally, a user interface can directly call a backend service, and then that backend service goes straight in to inserting a record to a database. But that was like decades ago. Since then, a lot of improvements already happened. Messaging came to the rescue in order to handle millions and billions of concurrent transactions happening around. Imagine if you have millions of users of your application and would push messages all over the place. Your database and backend processing services won‚Äôt be able to do it.</p>
<p>A lot of these are now managed via cloud natives services. There are so many variations now depending on which use case are you looking at. However, there are still a lot of use case for local or bare metal implementation of this. This is where Kafka and RabbitMQ shine. They do support various topologies or techniques, such as Pub/Sub, Fan-Out, Streaming, and a lot more. It‚Äôs a topic of interest to me, because those individual messages could mean something to different people, but seeing them on a high level is just so fun to watch. Seeing millions and billions of transactions every day, it‚Äôs like seeing land traffic that is so smooth and seamless.</p>
