        <p>The ideal job exists. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but ideal. It&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re both learning and earning, and at the same time pursuing an interest. You should be learning, as the world changes, you&rsquo;re also adopting to the global trends. In a fulfilling career, making money is often a bonus or a vehicle to keep going. Often the ideal jobs are when you&rsquo;re enjoying the process and the daily grind of it, rather than just working on it for renumeration purposes. An ideal job is when you&rsquo;ve set up a goal today and few years later you&rsquo;re just astonished on how far you&rsquo;ve come and how much experience you gathered.</p>

        <p>Enjoy the little things. When we&rsquo;re working towards a huge and ambitious goal, we tend to be anxious about how we can get there. We then forget that it&rsquo;s actually a long journey, and you have to stop and rest once in a while. As part of this rest, you should also enjoy the simplest events in your life.</p>
<p>So what are these little things? Your child asking you to go for a play. The sunset. The sunrise. The good food that you&rsquo;re about to it. The new people that you meet. The little coding bug that you&rsquo;ve solved. We often forget how important these are as we&rsquo;re so pre-occupied on the big things. Enjoying these little things on a daily basis will keep you motivated to move forward. You will then be surprised that the big goals will turn into a milestone you will just cross easily.</p>

        <p>This past few months with the pandemic and lockdown, I haven&rsquo;t had a good chance of fixing my hairstyle. I stopped caring about it couple of years ago. From what people have told me, I look best and presentable when I have a shorter hair.</p>
<p>However there is a bigger symbolic reference of haircut on my end. It&rsquo;s about taking off some of the accumulated baggages that I had for the past few months in order to take more load eventually. I also feel, in general, that I am a little light headed or less stressed by having a short haircut. This is all placebo, I know.</p>
<p>Often because we&rsquo;re so busy from our work, relationships, and hobbies that we tend to forget personal care. Although this is subjective from person to person, but the concept of brushing your hair, or taking care of your skin, and anything cosmetic; it&rsquo;s good to take care of yourself once in a while. This is a form of break that you can do so that you&rsquo;ll have a time &ldquo;just for yourself&rdquo; which is again a good thing.</p>

        <p>Taking a nap is something I often forget these past few months because of working from home. I am a serial napper. I am notorious to take a nap anywhere. Even on 5 to 10 minute bus rides, I can still take a micro nap.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why I am so energetic both at work and at home before pandemic. I use the pocket of times to either do something that interests me or take this time for a nap. Given that I don&rsquo;t commute these past few days, I am just in the constant treadmill of work, notifications, and actions that I often forget to take a rest.</p>
<p>I would probably schedule naps in the afternoon so that I can be recharged for the night time when I&rsquo;m with the family. It&rsquo;s really about the quality of rest that we have. It was never about how long you sleep. I do remember time and time again, that my whole inspiration to do great work is so that I can take a good rest knowing that I&rsquo;ve done something.</p>

        <p>Love is effortful and attentive. It&rsquo;s a good disturbance in our lives. It is a continuous process that we develop on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s about giving the best quality time despite having limited free time because of all the work and ventures that you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s about the constant reminder of what really matters.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just say you love someone (or something) without putting the attention and effort on making it better. It&rsquo;s more around how you can cultivate those seeds in to something meaningful not just for yourself. Love is tiring and exhausting, but it&rsquo;s a good kind of restlessness. It means that you&rsquo;re actively working on it, you keep pouring in your effort and attention to it.</p>
<p>Love matters.</p>

        <p>In order to be successful, you have to do things differently from others. The key words are &ldquo;do&rdquo; and &ldquo;different&rdquo;; and both of them needs to be present. It&rsquo;s not enough to just &ldquo;be different&rdquo; - like you&rsquo;re different from others because of your background, personality, or skills. It&rsquo;s about applying actions on those different ideas. It&rsquo;s about trying to think outside the box, but also working on testing if the idea is viable.</p>
<p>Doing things different will make your odds higher than not doing it nor doing it just like everyone else. In this ever connected world of social media, internet, and mobile phones. In order to thrive, you have to create content that are uniquely different - something that establishes your brand. Success is inevitable once you put on the effort and constant iterations on it.</p>
<p>Do something different today, and you might propel yourself for future success!</p>
