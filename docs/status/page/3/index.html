        <p>It&rsquo;s the political season again in the Philippines and my whole network back there are all over places expressing their opinions and political views. At this point, I don&rsquo;t really have much to say about it, and I don&rsquo;t have the right mindset and priorities to be in it. I have other set of problems and deliverables to deal with. I have business ventures to run, and ideas that needs to be polished, tested, and executed.</p>
<p>As part of this, I would like to spend less time in the next couple of weeks on Social Media as a consumer. I&rsquo;d be solely using my social accounts as a content creator and posting using marketing tools. As usual, the problem that I have with social media is that when I don&rsquo;t interact with it, then it just becomes a COG machine that gets funneled in my head without me really getting much out of it.</p>

        <p>Investing is better than saving. But saving is way better than spending so much. Investing is a means of earning more money by using your existing money as an instrument. Again, money begets money.</p>
<p>My general rule in life is that whatever it takes, yield at least 6% more each year. This is just a guidance that you should earn at least 6% more to beat the inflation. Your money, if just sitting on the bank, will depreciate.</p>
<p>I would consider that I&rsquo;m lucky (not really that smart) because of some investments that I yielded into a lot for the past years. I would live as frugal as I can and earn as much as possible.</p>

        <p>There are so many topics you can talk about in life. There are things that are easily relatable to your actual experience, then there are those that are more abstract, some are just really so random.</p>
<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re writing or researching, you just have to define who is it for? Maybe it&rsquo;s for you, maybe it&rsquo;s for someone else, or maybe no one really has to know. The audience is really for you to work on later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing for the past 2 years, in order to be more organized with my thoughts and memories. I tend to just trust my brain in the past that I would be able to remember everything. I also thought that I can just contain all the ideas and emotions inside me. Obviously, I was wrong.</p>
<p>So whatever it takes, think of a topic you can talk or write about. Whether it&rsquo;s in &ldquo;draft&rdquo; or something you won&rsquo;t end up using to an article or blog, that&rsquo;s fine. What&rsquo;s important is that you are dedicated with whatever you wanted to do. Don&rsquo;t let these topics and thoughts to just stay in your head. Let loose, and put that into a content that can be consumed later on.</p>

        <p>How much is your time? That is the question you should always ask yourself. Over and over again, we have to know that the most valuable resource in this planet is your time and attention. It&rsquo;s not just about the title or the money that you have, although they can be really useful instruments for your means but it&rsquo;s not the ultimate resource.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of life is to find ways to actually make good use of those time. In an ideal world, we&rsquo;re 100% productive and won&rsquo;t be even spending the slightest millisecond on things that doesn&rsquo;t really contribute to your improvement (or the whole world for that matter.)</p>
<p>Value your time, as that&rsquo;s the only thing that you hold dear and can really control in life. Your decisions, your actions, your reactions, those are the things that are within the bound of your conscious decisions. Stay focused on where you want to spend your time. Don&rsquo;t get distracted from shiny things that you see from others. Don&rsquo;t get distracted from what others think - fuck what they think. Think of what you really want - for you and the people you hold dear.</p>

        <p>Never go to autopilot. This is a state when you&rsquo;re just trying to live the day, expecting a better tomorrow. I have to keep reminding myself from time to time if what I&rsquo;m doing is something that is within my ideals and interests, or I&rsquo;m just riding someone&rsquo;s (or something) wave. This is a life-long struggle as we know more about ourselves and what our &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; is.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard because there are some aspects of your life, like chores and work meetings, to be just &ldquo;BAU&rdquo; or business as usual. For as long as they constitutes to the greater goal or the bigger thing such as earning X amount of money - they are never wrong. What&rsquo;s wrong is that, if you&rsquo;re blindsided in doing something without understanding &ldquo;why&rdquo; you&rsquo;re doing it. Take control of your life, the world needs more &ldquo;doers&rdquo; than followers.</p>

        <p>Keep producing no matter how hard it gets. As a creative worker who is a programmer &amp; software architect, a business owner, a startup advisor, a writer, an amateur content creator, and a lot more; they all revolve in the digital realm of &ldquo;you must produce something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing I make sure I do everyday is I journal all my thoughts and significant events throughout the day. I always make sure I write for at least 15 minutes, every single day - even if I&rsquo;m not in the mood or it&rsquo;s a terrible day at work. I am committed to the process, not just seeking the outcome.</p>
<p>You will be measured by how much you get consistent on the things you are really passionate about. There is no such thing as waiting for motivation to strike, progress will just keep you going. Keep creating content, keep writing code, keep researching for the next startup unicorn, keep analysing business problems, only then you will find success.</p>

        <p>Ideas are cheap. As a noun, it means nothing but a reference to something that could be great. It&rsquo;s just an abstract concept that doesn&rsquo;t have any tangible way for either you or others to experience.</p>
<p>In order for ideas to mean something, it needs to transition from a noun to a verb (action) because by only putting the work and process on to it, that&rsquo;s when value comes in. Only then, the idea becomes a product, a service, an outcome - and eventually turn in to business, profit, and purpose.</p>
<p>Ideas that stay as noun, in time will be regrets. &ldquo;I had that idea long ago&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;I thought about that&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;If only I did that&hellip;&rdquo;
If you are really wedded to your idea, go do something about it. If not, move on&hellip;</p>
