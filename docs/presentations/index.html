<p>Hello there üëã Welcome to my little space of the internet that I can call mine.</p>
<p>For the past 10 years, I‚Äôve spent my career dealing with software and the cloud. I wore many hats from being a developer, tester, data engineer, IT operations, solutions architect, project manager, technical pre-sales, trainer, and everything else in between. I had some very successful outcomes and some that also failed or did not materialised. However, one thing is certain ‚Äì learning is process and the journey; there is no end.</p>
<p>I currently own a boutique software consulting company, <a href="https://datachain.consulting">Datachain Consulting</a>, which aims to democratise Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Internet of Things technologies as a differentiator for businesses. I choose my clients carefully and I decided to stay lean &amp; small. On the side, I am actively exploring ideas that can be turned into products or services as a longer term investment.</p>
<p>I am a <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001648?fullName=Michael%20John%20Timpoc%20Pe%C3%B1a">Microsoft MVP</a> and a continuous contributor to the community. It‚Äôs in my DNA to help others those who are struggling in tech, as I myself walked (and still am) to those same shoes. I‚Äôve decided to become more active in writing and creating contents. I present at conferences, user groups, and various events when I can.</p>
<p>Lately, I‚Äôm into productivity and the whole building your second brain hype. I am learning a lot of techniques and frameworks to keep myself motivated and productive. On my free time, I read books and enjoy various cardio activities such as running &amp; cycling.</p>
