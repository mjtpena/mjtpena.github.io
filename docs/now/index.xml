      <description>Never go to autopilot. This is a state when you&amp;rsquo;re just trying to live the day, expecting a better tomorrow.

      <description>Server networking and maintenance are the things I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like when I was younger. I really did like programming, coding, and general solutions architecture but I never really liked getting my hands dirty with server operations.</description>

      <description>Joining or starting a start-up is not as simple as it could be. There are a lot of complexity involved. From finding and partnering with the right set of people, to creating and building the actual product.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m particularly liking the Markdown format in creating notes. Thanks to [[RoamResearch]] and [[Hugo]] (with the whole JAMstack craze), I am being sucked in this cult.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s fun recording podcasts episode as this is a way for me to learn (or refresh) on topics with a different perspective.</description>

      <description>Overwhelmed. I think that&amp;rsquo;s a state when you have a lot of things in your mind and you&amp;rsquo;re fighting an internal battle on how to deal with your problems.</description>

      <description>Motivation is something that everyone needs in order to thrive in their day. Having motivation is like taking a bath: not because you had it yesterday, you&amp;rsquo;ll be okay for today and tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Running is an activity that I particularly like. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of rules, and it&amp;rsquo;s a sport or game that is natural to all of us humans.</description>

      <description>A productive day at work means I get to finish tasks that I committed on time. This rarely happens because either the estimates are wrong, or there are just so many things that happens unexpectedly.</description>

      <description>Learn to shut up. It&amp;rsquo;s easier said than done. Especially if you grew up to speak what&amp;rsquo;s on your mind. However, we weren&amp;rsquo;t taught how to listen - like properly listen to a person, surrounding, a video, and even thoughts.</description>

      <description>There is no such thing as perfect. You&amp;rsquo;ll just have to chase what&amp;rsquo;s going to be perfect for you. You will feel constant disappointment time and time again.</description>

      <description>Sleep is very important for the obvious health reasons. What I also found out is that having a good sleep allows me to be a creative thinker when I have to think of new ideas.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that there is such thing as a &amp;ldquo;deadline&amp;rdquo; or end of life for a project. You just define what you want to build given the time, resources, and talent that is available for you.</description>

      <description>Achieving &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; is actually very simple, but the process is often hard. For example, you want to be an author, all you have to do is to keep on writing - over and over, day in and out.</description>

      <description>What is success? Spoiler alert: It&amp;rsquo;s relative. What it means is that success would mean differently to each and every individual.</description>

      <description>Be careful with influencers. Most of the time, they are after their own agenda. You&amp;rsquo;re just a number in their likes, views, and subscribers.</description>

      <description>It’s few minutes before my talk, and I still feel a little bit nervous about it. I’ve been speaking to conferences for almost a decade now and I had all sorts of experiences with it already.</description>

      <description>Being busy does not always equate to being productive. You can just be in a state of busy because you think you&amp;rsquo;re doing something important.</description>
