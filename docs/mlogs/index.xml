      <description>Being busy does not always equate to being productive. You can just be in a state of busy because you think you&amp;rsquo;re doing something important. Sometimes, what you need is not &amp;ldquo;to be busy&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;to be focused&amp;rdquo; on a task at hand. Time management is always the key to ensure that you get the right things done in your glorified to do list. Next time, instead of saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m busy&amp;rdquo;, say something like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I have an urgent thing to finish, I&amp;rsquo;ll be right back to you.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s okay to be bored from time to time. It means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have something that is urgent and important. It&amp;rsquo;s bad to be bored if it&amp;rsquo;s a coping mechanism to avoid stress. A right amount of stress is good for you, to keep you challenged and energised - also in a way have purpose in life. Aim to have boring days, so that out of the stressful day, you have some time to recharge and contemplate on what&amp;rsquo;s really important for you.</description>
