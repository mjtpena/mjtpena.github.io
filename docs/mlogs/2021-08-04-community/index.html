    <p>Community is a place where you find people with similar interests or profession. I&rsquo;ve been involved with the tech community for a decade now, and I still love meeting new people and talk about ideas, problems, and solutions about tech! I present to these community groups from time to time, and would continue doing it for the years to come. It&rsquo;s because of the community, that I get to progress in my career. I learned a lot from the people around and I also learned as part of sharing my knowledge and experience to them.</p>
<p>These days, it&rsquo;s all virtual and I didn&rsquo;t particularly like this medium. I&rsquo;m having the &ldquo;zoom fatigue&rdquo; effect lately, when all the interactions are abstracted into virtual communications. If the idea is to consume a resource or knowledge material, sure doing it virtual is appropriate - given you can skip and fast forward contents. But if we&rsquo;re looking at interactions and engagement, it&rsquo;s really hard to feel it these days with an online presence. I think this is the new normal, and the future would need to cater both in-person and virtual events. However, the spirit of community and knowledge sharing is this what matters.</p>
