        <a class="micro-title"> Productive Day </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>A productive day at work means I get to finish tasks that I committed on time. This rarely happens because either the estimates are wrong, or there are just so many things that happens unexpectedly. I like having these days when I get to move on to the task at hand without allotting them some mental space on my head while I an with my family or during extra curricular activities. You need to know when to stop. Once you&rsquo;re done with a scheduled task, move on. Don&rsquo;t cling on it to your head.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Listen </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Learn to shut up. It&rsquo;s easier said than done. Especially if you grew up to speak what&rsquo;s on your mind. However, we weren&rsquo;t taught how to listen - like properly listen to a person, surrounding, a video, and even thoughts. There are so many things in this life that you can learn if you just sit, focus, and listen carefully. Listen. You can talk when it&rsquo;s the right time.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Perfect </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>There is no such thing as perfect. You&rsquo;ll just have to chase what&rsquo;s going to be perfect for you.  You will feel constant disappointment time and time again. Once you&rsquo;re in that treadmill of chasing perfection, you just keep getting hungry the further you go. Perfection is an enemy that most of us face when we&rsquo;re trying to do creative work like writing, coding, speaking, and art work. However, don&rsquo;t settle to mediocre. That&rsquo;s tasteless. Aim for competence, with effort - but not perfection.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Sleep </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Focus is very important. This is what sets a task to be done in months or days into hours and minutes. Having focus means having the dexterity to know where to shoot your arrow. For me to be in focus, I need to be in flow. I was a victim of being a &ldquo;hardworker&rdquo; in the past, where I burn the midnight oil to non-valuable things.</p>
<p>I need to make sure I setup my mindset and environment to respect my thought processing. In time, it&rsquo;s getting easier for me to achieve FLOW because of exercise and meditation. I don&rsquo;t force myself if I can&rsquo;t do it anymore. Take some rest if needed. All of those thoughts are just cars passing by. Let them pass.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Sleep </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Sleep is very important for the obvious health reasons. What I also found out is that having a good sleep allows me to be a creative thinker when I have to think of new ideas. I do have a habit of staying up late if I need or want to finish something. If the means to do it is already defined, such as programming a module with clear business requirements - all I need is the time, focus, and resources to do it. On the more creative side of things such as presenting, attending meetings, and brainstorming - I prefer to have a good night sleep!</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Deadlines </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t believe that there is such thing as a &ldquo;deadline&rdquo; or end of life for a project. You just define what you want to build given the time, resources, and talent that is available for you. A deadline could probably be re-word as a milestone or a target, in which there is a certain state that you&rsquo;re looking for a product to be developed. Deadlines are stressful, I want to avoid that word. Let&rsquo;s talk about milestones, targets, outcomes, and results!</p>

      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>[[Binaural Beats]] is a type of music that really works for me. It helps me stay relaxed, calm, and focused. This is my go to playlist when I need to work at night. This is particularly useful if I already know what I need to do, and I just need the right set of mindset to execute them. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a go to music while doing creative or logical work such as programming or writing.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Achieving Success </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Achieving &ldquo;success&rdquo; is actually very simple, but the process is often hard. For example, you want to be an author, all you have to do is to keep on writing - over and over, day in and out. You won&rsquo;t be an author &ldquo;overnight&rdquo; per-se, it&rsquo;s those thousands and millions of words that come out of your mind and the hundreds of revisions that will make you an author.</p>
<p>The same applies to being an entrepreneur, all you have to do is to keep on exploring business opportunities. Keep on selling solutions to people&rsquo;s problem. It&rsquo;s about the constant market research, the cold-calling, networking events, and so on. You don&rsquo;t become a successful entrepreneur just by &ldquo;being lucky&rdquo; overnight. It&rsquo;s often a mixture of &ldquo;relative effort&rdquo;, resources, and luck.</p>
<p>Another example is doing marathons. To be good at running, cycling, swimming, and other cardio activities - you just have to keep training repeatedly. Again, simple but hard.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> What is success? </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>What is success? Spoiler alert: It&rsquo;s relative. What it means is that success would mean differently to each and every individual. Other would consider having a lot of money as successful. For some, it&rsquo;s about having influence and fanbase. Others is about being a CEO or Director of a company.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Online Influencers </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Be careful with influencers. Most of the time, they are after their own agenda. You&rsquo;re just a number in their likes, views, and subscribers.</p>
<p>There are dangers of being a consumer of a product - excessively. Participate when you can. Add a comment, share your insights, write about what you think.</p>
