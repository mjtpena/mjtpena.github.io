        <a class="micro-title"> Markdown </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>I&rsquo;m particularly liking the Markdown format in creating notes. Thanks to [[RoamResearch]] and [[Hugo]] (with the whole JAMstack craze), I am being sucked in this cult. I am actually realizing the benefits as I have more structure on my thoughts and flow of information. I follow a format that would work to most systems these days, and it&rsquo;s easy to convert and transpose anywhere.</p>
<p>I am still learning some of the advanced capabilities of Markdown. But so far the basic indenting, header, attaching of images are more than enough to get the hook of it. In the future, I would probably be looking at advanced formatting and positioning of texts / images. Also, I am also king [[Marp]] as a tool to convert Markdowns to PDF or PPT.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Podcasts </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>It&rsquo;s fun recording podcasts episode as this is a way for me to learn (or refresh) on topics with a different perspective. It is also an interactive way for me to meet and know more about the person. These days, [[Bryan Anthony Garcia]] and I are doing [[The Battle of Clouds]] and it&rsquo;s a good way to immortalize topics. We give it a twist in a way that it&rsquo;s catered to young Filipino audience.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Overwhelmed </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Overwhelmed. I think that&rsquo;s a state when you have a lot of things in your mind and you&rsquo;re fighting an internal battle on how to deal with your problems. Sometimes the answers are not very clear and you don&rsquo;t have the answers right away. To overcome this state, you have to stop what you&rsquo;re doing and try to look from a far. You have to re-organize your thoughts on what&rsquo;s really important and what&rsquo;s urgent. In the grand scheme of things, all the items in your head are just flow of information that changes state and needs further processing. So stop. Re-think. Attack again.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Motivation </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Motivation is something that everyone needs in order to thrive in their day. Having motivation is like taking a bath: not because you had it yesterday, you&rsquo;ll be okay for today and tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a constant energy that fuels us to drive the pathway of chaos. We can get motivation from finishing goals, acquiring things, or when we feel valued. There are many ways to attain it, even simple meditation or exercise can do the trick sometimes. Obviously some day are really just hard, but when you can - get motivated! Own the day.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Running </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Running is an activity that I particularly like. It doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of rules, and it&rsquo;s a sport or game that is natural to all of us humans. It&rsquo;s something you can do as a group or alone, again not much rules. I find running &ldquo;meditative&rdquo; as this allows me to wrap around my head in terms of flow of thoughts and how to solve or approach a specific problem at hand. I&rsquo;m not an athlete in terms of running or nothing competitive at this point. I just want to do it for the obvious health benefits and the state of flow it gives me. I recommend it to those who work as a creative thinker.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Productive Day </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>A productive day at work means I get to finish tasks that I committed on time. This rarely happens because either the estimates are wrong, or there are just so many things that happens unexpectedly. I like having these days when I get to move on to the task at hand without allotting them some mental space on my head while I an with my family or during extra curricular activities. You need to know when to stop. Once you&rsquo;re done with a scheduled task, move on. Don&rsquo;t cling on it to your head.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Listen </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Learn to shut up. It&rsquo;s easier said than done. Especially if you grew up to speak what&rsquo;s on your mind. However, we weren&rsquo;t taught how to listen - like properly listen to a person, surrounding, a video, and even thoughts. There are so many things in this life that you can learn if you just sit, focus, and listen carefully. Listen. You can talk when it&rsquo;s the right time.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Perfect </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>There is no such thing as perfect. You&rsquo;ll just have to chase what&rsquo;s going to be perfect for you.  You will feel constant disappointment time and time again. Once you&rsquo;re in that treadmill of chasing perfection, you just keep getting hungry the further you go. Perfection is an enemy that most of us face when we&rsquo;re trying to do creative work like writing, coding, speaking, and art work. However, don&rsquo;t settle to mediocre. That&rsquo;s tasteless. Aim for competence, with effort - but not perfection.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Sleep </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Focus is very important. This is what sets a task to be done in months or days into hours and minutes. Having focus means having the dexterity to know where to shoot your arrow. For me to be in focus, I need to be in flow. I was a victim of being a &ldquo;hardworker&rdquo; in the past, where I burn the midnight oil to non-valuable things.</p>
<p>I need to make sure I setup my mindset and environment to respect my thought processing. In time, it&rsquo;s getting easier for me to achieve FLOW because of exercise and meditation. I don&rsquo;t force myself if I can&rsquo;t do it anymore. Take some rest if needed. All of those thoughts are just cars passing by. Let them pass.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Sleep </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Sleep is very important for the obvious health reasons. What I also found out is that having a good sleep allows me to be a creative thinker when I have to think of new ideas. I do have a habit of staying up late if I need or want to finish something. If the means to do it is already defined, such as programming a module with clear business requirements - all I need is the time, focus, and resources to do it. On the more creative side of things such as presenting, attending meetings, and brainstorming - I prefer to have a good night sleep!</p>
