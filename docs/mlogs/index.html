        <a class="micro-title"> Season </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Winter, spring, summer, or fall - I love bits and pieces of them. I love that on winter I can have a cool environment to sleep on. I hate winter, because it gets dark too early! I love spring because of the beautiful plants and flowers around, but I also hate it because of hay fever. I love summer because it&rsquo;s the best time to go to the beach and you have a lot of day time to spend outside business hours. I hate it when it&rsquo;s extremely hot and it causes bushfires! I love fall because when it&rsquo;s rainy, I get to concentrate with my work. For obvious reasons of rain, I don&rsquo;t want to see dried leaves that much (it looks sad). You see, you can&rsquo;t have everything. I tend to focus more on the advantages of each seasons, rather than complaining all the time.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Community </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Community is a place where you find people with similar interests or profession. I&rsquo;ve been involved with the tech community for a decade now, and I still love meeting new people and talk about ideas, problems, and solutions about tech! I present to these community groups from time to time, and would continue doing it for the years to come. It&rsquo;s because of the community, that I get to progress in my career. I learned a lot from the people around and I also learned as part of sharing my knowledge and experience to them.</p>
<p>These days, it&rsquo;s all virtual and I didn&rsquo;t particularly like this medium. I&rsquo;m having the &ldquo;zoom fatigue&rdquo; effect lately, when all the interactions are abstracted into virtual communications. If the idea is to consume a resource or knowledge material, sure doing it virtual is appropriate - given you can skip and fast forward contents. But if we&rsquo;re looking at interactions and engagement, it&rsquo;s really hard to feel it these days with an online presence. I think this is the new normal, and the future would need to cater both in-person and virtual events. However, the spirit of community and knowledge sharing is this what matters.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Practice </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Practice makes perfect. Maybe not &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; for everyone, but close to the objective or your goal. It takes a lot of repetition to truly master a craft or a profession, you need to spend a lot of those hours in order to learn what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work. For most of the time, practicing is a mental game of repetition in order to really &ldquo;nail it.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t just be an expert to a specific topic overnight. You can have an opinion about it, but not an expert. It&rsquo;s those repeated failures and struggles that will emerge you as an expert to that topic or practice.</p>

      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Building a house is not easy. There are so many things involved and it can get complicated and complex really quick. There are just so many things to consider such as the price, design, and a lot of other things. It&rsquo;s a process that you have to undergo if you want to really become invested emotionally to the property that you&rsquo;re building. It takes a lot of sleepless nights and divided attention, not to mention the anxiety that this brings on your head. So if you think you want to build a house, have a think again.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Weekends </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Weekends are very important to me now. Back then, I treat it as a way to do more work while others are busy with their personal lives. That was so wrong in so many levels. For one, you need the actual rest so that you&rsquo;ll have the energy and motivation for the week ahead. Another thing is that, it&rsquo;s also the time to do things that you don&rsquo;t normally do during work time. This includes doing side projects, exploring new hobbies, and making memories with your family and friends. At the end of the week, it&rsquo;s really what matters that count, not the amount of $$$ that you have.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Startup </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Joining or starting a start-up is not as simple as it could be. There are a lot of complexity involved. From finding and partnering with the right set of people, to creating and building the actual product. This is a very competitive space and would require a lot of energy, passion, and attention. Unlike a side-project that you can just run, a startup requires focus and product market fit. If you have the time, energy, and resources I would advise for you t o give it a try. If you&rsquo;re only going to do it half-heartedly, then it&rsquo;s best not to proceed.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Markdown </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>I&rsquo;m particularly liking the Markdown format in creating notes. Thanks to [[RoamResearch]] and [[Hugo]] (with the whole JAMstack craze), I am being sucked in this cult. I am actually realizing the benefits as I have more structure on my thoughts and flow of information. I follow a format that would work to most systems these days, and it&rsquo;s easy to convert and transpose anywhere.</p>
<p>I am still learning some of the advanced capabilities of Markdown. But so far the basic indenting, header, attaching of images are more than enough to get the hook of it. In the future, I would probably be looking at advanced formatting and positioning of texts / images. Also, I am also king [[Marp]] as a tool to convert Markdowns to PDF or PPT.</p>

      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>It&rsquo;s fun recording podcasts episode as this is a way for me to learn (or refresh) on topics with a different perspective. It is also an interactive way for me to meet and know more about the person. These days, [[Bryan Anthony Garcia]] and I are doing [[The Battle of Clouds]] and it&rsquo;s a good way to immortalize topics. We give it a twist in a way that it&rsquo;s catered to young Filipino audience.</p>

      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Overwhelmed. I think that&rsquo;s a state when you have a lot of things in your mind and you&rsquo;re fighting an internal battle on how to deal with your problems. Sometimes the answers are not very clear and you don&rsquo;t have the answers right away. To overcome this state, you have to stop what you&rsquo;re doing and try to look from a far. You have to re-organize your thoughts on what&rsquo;s really important and what&rsquo;s urgent. In the grand scheme of things, all the items in your head are just flow of information that changes state and needs further processing. So stop. Re-think. Attack again.</p>

        <a class="micro-title"> Motivation </a>
      </div>
      <span>    
        <a class="micro-content"> <p>Motivation is something that everyone needs in order to thrive in their day. Having motivation is like taking a bath: not because you had it yesterday, you&rsquo;ll be okay for today and tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a constant energy that fuels us to drive the pathway of chaos. We can get motivation from finishing goals, acquiring things, or when we feel valued. There are many ways to attain it, even simple meditation or exercise can do the trick sometimes. Obviously some day are really just hard, but when you can - get motivated! Own the day.</p>
